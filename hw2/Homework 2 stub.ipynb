       "  'review/text': 'It had been several years since my last Okocim Porter. Apparently their distribution network excluded the USA for some time and all I had going for me was a distant memory of a great beer that once helped awaken me to the world of possibilities great beer had to offer. \\t\\t\\tWhen I heard that Okocim Porter was back in the good old U.S. of A, I couldnt wait to see if this rich Baltic porter lived up to the image of perfection Id assigned to it in memory. Unfortunately, my bottle was probably a bit fatigued and the flavor just didnt hit all the high notes as Im sure it should have. There may be several reasons for this aside from sitting too long on the shelf at Johns Market. One is that the bottle isnt bottle conditioned so the beer isnt working while its waiting. The other is that theyve obviously modified the recipe since reintroducing it to the American market, as the ABV on the new label says 8.3% while my old bottle from 03 or so still says 8.1%. Another hunch is the possibility that the beer is now pasteurized. \\t\\t\\tWas something lost along the way? Hard to say, though it does appear that the higher ratings for this beer trend towards the pre-2005 era. As for my revisitation, I noted a taste like toffee and coca-cola with a splash of molasses. The body was bottomless brown with a camelhair head and dilute phenolic fragrance with a hint of coffee and sugar. Im not giving up on this beer, but my recent reacquaintance was a bit of a let down. \\t\\t\\tBy the way, Okocim has absolutely the coolest website of any brewery Ive ever seen. Check it out.',\n",

There's a first for everything, we guess.\\t\\tThe fizzy lace lacks any real retention; the active carbonation is the only thing keeping it alive. Hazed, brownish burgundy color is borderline opaque. Toasted biscuit and sweet-tart blackberry aroma. Thick, viscous smoothness shows that the beer has a full body, yet enough crispness makes its way through. Toasted and mild caramel maltiness comes in layers as the blackberry flavor blankets the palate. Clean malt all around with a ghost-like nutty yeast in the middle. Kiss of hop bitterness is not sharp enough to rise above the berry flavor. Finishes slightly sweet, with a grainy and faded berry flavor.\\t\\tThis one is an oddball; nothing's really bad about it, it's just an odd mix of flavors. Regardless, it's worth a try.

       "  'review/text': \"Poured into a weizen glass, had to pull the bottle away a little to get any head on it. Maybe a finger of foam tops the hazy orange body. A ring of sediment was in the bottle, so I poured that in too. Spindly webs of lace circle the glass. Steady carbonation. Faint banana ester from the yeast when it's first poured. Aroma slides downward after that, mostly papery cardboard. It retains a doughy malt aroma also, which counters the paper products. \\t\\tLightly sweet, papery malt again, very faint bitterness toward the end. Aftertaste has some residual apple flavor. It has a fuller mouthfeel than typical Euro lagers, more like a Czech Pilsner. It's not overly alcoholic at all either, which works well. It's somewhat bland, but has a sort of rustic character about it. I would try it again for the price. \\t\\tThis is a fairly new arrival in the area, hopefully the bottle is less than 6-8 months old. Imported by J&B Brands Chicago, IL.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Presentation: 12oz. brown bottle.\\t\\tAppearance: Bright copper beer, crowned with a nice ivory cap. There's decent retention, and actually pretty nice sheets of lacing. There's some super-fine sediment in the beer as well.\\t\\tSmell: Sharp, fresh, piney hops, backed by a mild caramel sweetness. Not too complex, but the aromas are pretty, with nice balance. \\t\\tTaste: Very much in keeping with the aromas. It's very hop-forward, with a nice, full hop profile of fruit and pine. There's just enough malty sweetness in the background to make this perfectly balanced. What's really nice about this is that the hop flavor is nice and prominent, but it's not harshly bitter in any way. Bitterness is medium and nicely balanced with the malt character. \\t\\tMouthfeel: Maybe just a tad heavy on the carbonation (it's a bit prickly) but other than that, quite nice, with medium mouthfeel.\\t\\tDrinkability: As sessionable an IPA as I've ever tasted.\\t\\tConclusion: My experiences with O'Fallon brewery have been mixed, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this one. I was fairly impressed with this beer, however. The only criticism I have is that there's not as much depth some other IPA's...on the flipside, however, is extreme drinkability and a solid, classic flavor profile.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass\\t\\tPours an impenetrable black that seems to suck all the light out of the room with a wonderful, dense, and amazingly persistent mocha head that leaves some exquisite lacing. In short, its one damn fine looking beer. The aroma is incredible. Roasted coffee is dominant but there is more going on here, there is a bit of fudge as well. I can smell the coffee in this beer from a few feet away. Just after looking at and smelling this beer I cannot wait to try it. This beer does not disappoint. The roastyness is, initially less intense than the aroma, this simply serves to allow the malt, silky oats, and bitter chocolatey goodness to show themselves. There is a slight acrid character to this from the roasted malts (usually not something I welcome in beers but) it pairs incredibly well with the other flavors here. The roasted malts come after the chocolate but are replaced by a smooth silkiness from the oats. This flavor is overtaken by the coffee which lingers long into the finish. The mouthfeel is wonderful. At first it felt a bit thin but then as I let it linger a bit on my palate I was able to appreciate its greatness. It is medium-full in body and smooth as silk. It feels almost weightless yet heavy and robust at the same time. Drinkability on this is awesome, damn near exceptional. I'm trying to make the bottle last because it has evolved so wonderfully over the course on this glass that I can't wait to see how it'll change next. I had high expectations that got even higher after reveling in its beauty and intriguing aromas and, needless to say, my expectations were met.\",\n",

Good balance of carbonation and flavor. It's impossible to write about this beer without comparing it to Kentucky Breakfast Stout. CBS finishes with a sweet aftertaste probably from the maple syrup wheras KBS finishes with a strong alcohol flavor. This makes CBS much more drinkable in my opinion.\",\n",

Not an overwhelming smell, but the malt and coffee overtones are present. Alcohol is present, but does not overtake the malty & chocolate taste. An excellent, not overdone flavor. With the low carbonization and thin ale texture, it feels light for a stout in your mouth. A surprisingly drinkable imperial stout, I had a couple this evening quite easily.',\n",

Nice malty nose with lots of toffee, brown sugar and just a touch of alcohol. The taste evolves as this beer warms. Lots of nice toasty caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, with a hint of nuttiness to it. Just a touch of bitterness on the finish to balance it out. The slightly higher alcohol is really well hidden which makes this extremely drinkable. Reminded me of sitting in a pub in London.

Dirty Bastard is fairly hoppy for the style, but I don't pick up any hops in this beer. \\t\\tT - Yahtzeee!!! The first sip hit like a ton of bricks, eyes watered as if I just had a shot of straight bourbon. Other patrons sitting around said the same thing, this keg must have been pulled from a very strong barrel that still had some bourbon in it. The taste is of bourbon with definite vanilla and oak notes. There are good notes of caramel, and canned fruit in a sweet syrup, some toffee too. Eventually, by about the fourth good sip, the bourbon hit calms down and you get a nice smoothing effect, plenty of complexity...the bourbon and sweetness of the beer come together well. \\t\\tM - Thick mouthfeel with lower carbonation. This beer is smooth as all hell and chewy. I don't know how Founders gets the mouthfeel so perfect in everything from an IPA to a Scotch Ale, but they do. Once the booze numbs you, it goes down the hatch really well. \\t\\tO - Definitely a sipper, but this is one that just comes together right. It would be better with less booziness on the initial hit, but that seemed to go away as it warmed and I got further into the glass.\",\n",

Rich chocolate colored tan foam that rose up a good two inches over the top of the glass before finally settling down to a thin half inch layer that lasted the rest of the session, but not before dropping copious amounts of side glass lace all over the sides. Really nice and a classic stout look.\\t\\tSo as I go in and take a closer look I was a bit surprised to be honest. This really did not smell much like an oatmeal stout. At least to me it was much more reminiscent of a Baltic porter, well at first it did. It had that sharp alcohol nose to it and a hint of some dark spicy fruit mixed in. Quite interesting and definitely more then a little unique. I decided to let it warm to really bring out what was hiding in here and then came out the nice sweet notes of chocolate and coffee along with hints of lactose that I was looking for. The flavors followed along with a hint again something sweet, but yet a tart sort of fruit flavor as well. Very nice. Very rich full body on this one with great carbonation that never really gave up any ground at all.',\n",

I like it either way.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Watery and easy to consume. Slight carbonation and the bitter finish is drying and pleasantly cloying. Easy to consume. Alcohol is hidden beneath the bitterness.\\t\\tDrinkability: I like this beer. It is deeper than most APAs that I\\'ve had. I would certainly drink this beer again if I can get it.',\n",

The smell has more of a hop character than I expected. Flowery and hoppy, with a pils-like malt foundation. Just a touch of sweetness in the taste, with a nice hop flavor. More pilsner malt comes forth in the taste than the aroma. I have to admit, its much better than expected, and certainly better than just okay. Soft and rounded body, which leans appropriately to the lighter side. Hoppy finish, although a little more bitterness would have been appreciated.

The color was a lot more reddish than I would have expected. Almost looked like an amber ale. Not much noticed when I took a deep smell. Taste was fairly pleasing. Slight more hoppiness than an amber ale. Hint of fruit on the palate. At only 5% abv and with a deceivingly good drinkability, it was a very nice beer to start the night off with. I don't often order ESB, but I would have another of these again.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"I was finally able to latch onto this particular Aecht Schlenkerla hybrid while in Boston. I found it at Charles St. Liquors. Seeing how hefeweizens are one of my favorite styles and I've loved the previous Aecht Schlenkerla rauchbiers I've had, this one had real promise in my mind.\\tI poured the contents of the .5L bottle into a weizen glass and got a look at a murky brownish colored beer exhibiting a high level of carbonation and a fluffy light tan head that acted just like a weizen's. In fact, on appearance alone, it looked just like a dunkelweissbier.\\tA quick sniff and I was immediately disabused of that line of thought. Hearty smoke aroma virtually leapt from the glass, all nice and meaty with what I believe was a beechwood note. There was a secondary fruity-sweet note that gave it an added dimension.\\tThe taste had a lighter smokiness than the Marzen or Ur-bock but it was still quite potent. It had the back-of-the-tongue bite you get when you encounter a burnt-out section of a forest after a brush fire. There was also a tangy teriyaki meat flavor, slightly citrusy and sweet. The feel was a lot like a hefeweizen; light-bodied, crisp, lively and dry.\\tOverall, this offering was quite enjoyable and easily drinkable. An interesting merging of two styles, I liked this one though not as much as either the Marzen or Ur-bock. Still, this is one rauchbier you should try.\",\n",

Fortunately the marvelous Okocim porter is among those to have found their way to our shores. \\t\\tIts a robust, strong looking beer, This brew is very dark for a porter and has a rich chocolate colored head. As I do find with many from this genre, the head tends to fade rapidly no matter how you pour it.\\t\\tYou will find in the nose fantastic aromas that include dark chocolate, some coffee, and boiled fruitcake like elements. The flavor is definately one of the worlds finest examples of the style. It begins in with the usual chocolate and coffee taste, but then moves into a whole other territory. There are lots of sweet spices like cinnamon and nutmeg present, along with just a hint of cloves, plenty of dried fruit characters that give it a warming, medicinal quality. It also has a clean, dry finish that compliments the other characters of the beer and prevent it from getting sickly sweet, as some dark beers from eastern Europe are wont to do.Okocim porter is not too full bodied, and despite the alcohol content does not come off as too sweet or overpowering. It's also another beer that improves as it warms.\\t\\tI rate this highly in the drinkability stakes because it is smooth and, despite its complexities, is not too overwhelming. Be warned tho, the ABV WILL catch up with you sooner rather than later, especially if you have more than one. It is perfect as a session closer, or with a slab of just about any kind of rich European style cake (As a personal preference i've been known to drink this while eating a chunk of panforte). \\t\\tOne of my very favorite porters and arguably the number one in its class, Okocim have brewed an absolute belter of a beer here, and it's one i'm hoping i'll be seeming on my local bottle o shelves for a long time to come.\",\n",

The carbonation is on the down low, the body medium weight, a wee bit zippy in the way of the hop, but nonetheless generally smooth.

After five minutes, it's still a substantial cap that just sits there, not even breaking down. Stalwart and stately... it's got attitude.\\t\\tSmell- Baked goods, like cookies spiced with rum or a fruitcake. There's some dark fruits like fig and date as well, and even some chocolate truffles... a huge malty profile steals the show here.\\t\\tTaste- Something seems just a bit off, as the aftertaste carries with it a suggestion of oversteeped tea and phenols... the date of 8329 is lasered at the bottom, so it's not too old of an example. The malts and rich fruity character is there, it's just masked a little bit by the aforementioned flavors and a remarkable bitterness.\\t\\tMouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture is quiet and reserved, yet slick and foamy enough to be enjoyable.

       "  'review/text': 'It\\'s difficult to take this beer seriously when the brewery calls it a \"red\" ale and it is, in fact, golden. Even the highest paid attorneys would have a hard time arguing this as even amber, let alone red. That obvious blunder notwithstanding, the beer still looks humdrum. Its tone is tarnished and carbonation lifeless. \\t\\tGiven the appearance I can\\'t say I\\'m surprised to find that the aroma is boring, or that it lacks all the typical caramelly, biscuity, lightly toasty maltiness that characterizes the best examples of the style. It\\'s far from foul though. The faint scent of grain husks, honeyed oats and delicate florals is actually fairly pleasant, if anything too understated. \\t\\tSay what you will about Trafalgar\\'s poor quality control, and about how even their more approachable brands are still painfully, pointlessly underwhelming, but truth be told the commercial Irish reds are no better. In fact, Paddy\\'s emulates them well. It has only minimal grainy maltiness, a muted sweetness, a dash of hard minerals and faint impression of adjunct. It\\'s without much character and sure to be quaffable to the average palate. \\t\\tNot all the style\\'s charm is lost, a great deal of it is there, albeit partial and understated. A light floral quality can be traced from sip to swallow. It imparts a delicate bitterness and refreshing, spring-time tone. The sweetness of the malts, although awfully stunted, has a very loose caramel quality. And the finish is dry and with a halfway roastiness. \\t\\tTrafalgar\\'s slogan is: \"We only sell what we can\\'t drink ourselves!\". There\\'s a reason you can find so much of their brands on the shelves here in Ontario - obviously even they don\\'t want to drink the stuff themselves. Certainly no one else will want to take it. While Paddy\\'s may be one of their more agreeable offerings - in that it\\'s not infected and reasonably drinkable - it\\'s still strives to be nothing more than an average beer.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Presentation: Friday 9th April, 2004 was spent in Binche, Belgium, the home of Brasserie La Binchoise. Sadly our planned trip to both the Brewery and on-premises Tavern proved fruitless thanks to the fact that it was closed.\\t\\tAfter a few beers in the nearby Du Cte De Chez Boule our small party headed into the main square. Here we sampled some brews at La Chamade whilst looking at the many pictures of the Carnival that adorns the walls. La Binchoise Bire des Ours was the third brew and was served from the Bottle. The dark brown label has a honeycombed background with a large Bear on it; I couldnt help thinking about Winnie the Pooh when I saw this!\\t\\tAppearance: Arrived in a tall 75cl brown glass bottle, cork and caged, which was shared between a few of us. Poured a light golden color that had a honeyed hue. The head was rocky and beige in color. A thick crusty lacing is a nice byproduct of the tasting experience. Solid finely attenuated conditioning.\\t\\tNose: A Belgium Pale Ale nose, strong in stature with a nice honey odor that hangs heavy in the mouth of the glass, sweet but not sickly. Alcohol is detectable.\\t\\tTaste: A mild tasting brew initially I found, it takes time to break this one down. Delicate flavors at first but as the beer warms and you become accustomed to this gorgeous honey beer the warming feel fills the mouth. Lightly toasted malts at first, a high alcohol feel on the first sip, honey residue in the back third but it is not overtly sweet at all. Dry finish that reminded me of some cough candy available in the UK called Lockets. This was has a very nice profile.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Beautifully smooth feel, slick honey like body oozes on the tongue and fills the mouth. Honey oil alcohols are high. Very smooth and a great beer to finish our visit with, especially given its high strength!\\t\\tDrinkability: More of a sipper rather than a session beer, the 75cl would have been difficult on my own I think, but shared amongst friends it was not that hard to take a decent Glass each. A great beer to finish the night with.\\t\\tOverall: A very nicely attenuated honey beer, the honey is added prior to the main fermentation and I think this really helps to thoroughly disperse the sweetness of the honey, so much so that it even adds to the alcohol level. \\t\\tNicely put together and probably one of the rarer offerings from Brasserie La Binchoise.',\n",

Very faint touches of the oatmeal, but honestly this thing just screams coffee/chocolate without any sweetness at all. Dark and SUPER BITTER coffee or chocolate.\\t\\tTaste is full bodied and immediately hits with the dark bitter chocolate and coffee flavors. It's strange because both the dark bitter unsweetened chocolate and extremely bitter espresso are equally present and yet sort of shuffle back and forth so you're never quite sure which one is the flavor you're experiencing at the moment. Bitterness isn't overly deadly, at least not when it comes to the hops. You can taste it's there, but it works perfectly in step with the bitter coffee and choclate flavors. Hop taste, again, it's there with some mild floral or even citrus notes, but for the most part it's just a compliment to the big burnt coffee. Ends with a beautiful long boot leather, coffee and dark unsweetened chocolate bitterness.\\t\\tFounder's can't make a bad beer. I hate calling this a one trick pony.

Not a lot going on here, but inviting just the same.\\t\\tI was expecting a bit of a hop wallop by looking at the menu, but the server told me that this beer \"has a fairly mild and subdued hop flavor, but is great with food.\" He was correct. Flavors of pine are a bit muted here leaving you wanting a little more in the hop department. Bisquit and light caramel flavors are nice. A floral tinge lingers in the middle while the subdued pine note provides the connection to bring it together. Yes, a good brew to have with a meal. Not an in your face IPA.\\t\\tI though Panther was a good feel. Carbonation was right and body was in the middle for me.\\t\\tOverall this is one that won\\'t knock your socks off, but it will go well with much of the menu there.

The taste is very crisp with some pleasant bitter hops that are very refreshing and some grassiness and graininess as well. The slightest bit of cereal sweetness on the finish. The mouthfeel is very crisp, but not bone dry. Very drinkable, especially on a 100 degree day.

       "  'review/text': 'A - Pours like a slightly thinned black enamel with a nice two-finger, medium-brown head that fades fairly quickly, but leaves heavy lacing in its wake.\\t\\tS - Sweet-smelling, with strong vanilla and chocolate, not unlike a malted black-and-white milkshake. No kidding. Undertones of tobacco and (obviously) bourbon. Possibly the best-smelling beer I\\'ve ever sniffed. Almost seems a sin to drink, but if I must...\\t\\tT - Up-front malt, oak, and warm alcohol on first sip, not unlike what I imagine a coffee-flavored bourbon to taste. Second sip brings out more flavors. This is a complex brew. Lots of tastes now. Chocolate more pronounced, and oak moves to the finish. Lots of dark flavors and slight spice.\\t\\tM - Smooth and chewy like a stout should be, but finishes quite dry. Has a little bite to it. Coats the palette and lingers, even a few minutes after finishing.\\t\\tD - Due to the dry finish and complexity, it practically begs to be sipped over and over. I often drink stouts quite slowly, but not this. It\\'s what I call \"dangerous\" - high alcohol that is incredibly drinkable. Possibly the most drinkable stout I\\'ve had.\\t\\tOverall, I wasn\\'t entirely sure what to expect, especially being such a fan of the \"ordinary\" Breakfast Stout. While I\\'m not entirely certain it lives up to hype, my score certainly tells a different story. I can honestly say that I think it\\'s the best stout I\\'ve had. However, I think I still *prefer* to drink others.',\n",

Chicory is also present. To me this taste like it has more than 60 IBU's, which is stated on the label. Perhaps that is why I was a bit suprised, not what I was expecting.

Bourbon shows through nicely, actually much beter than on some of the other maple bourbon beers I've tried from Founders. Clove, maple, dates, caramel, raisin, dried fig, and more. Thick luscious with that spritzy carbonation on the finish. Christ I'm gonna savor this case.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Founders Centennial IPA is a beer that I've had in bottles before and was not impressed with. I felt that the bitterness was harsh and it was oxidized, but on draft (and form a growler), this is a FANTASTIC IPA. I guess this is probably a common phenomenon with very flavorul, hoppy beers that just don't keep well, which is probably why Pliny the Elder is hardly available outside of Northern California in bottle form--great IPA's do not travel well and suffer from storage.\\t\\tThis IPA has the best raw hop flavor of any beer I've had. I think that as a homebrewer, I am exposed to the best ingredients in raw and final form--this beer tastes and smells just like Centennial hops from a new vacuum sealed pack. It has that fruit loops aroma, with a woody depth and grapefruit punch. On the pallet, the hops provide great flavor of fresh peeled pomelo and juicy tangerines. The malt contributes a bit of caramel sweetness and solid body that makes for a luscious well-rounded beer.\",\n",

Can smell the hops right up front. Interesting flavor. Hops dominate the mouth, but there is that subtle bit of Belgian sweetness that appears in there to tone down the hops just a tad so I can enjoy it. Very smooth finish. Served in small portions, I could drink a couple of these. But for a hop head, it could be an all night affair. I would consider this more of a Belgian IPA than the way it was described on the menu (to paraphrase) as a Belgian style hoppy tripel. Another high quality creation from CBC though.',\n",

Coffee is still very prevalent yet probably faded a touch but still there enough to mix with the bourbon and the chocolate to create an extremely complex blend of flavors that - if I hadn't had CBS recently - I would have been blown away by.\\t\\tM: Huge bodied, lightly carbonated. Sticky thick mouth coating leaves me wanting more and more yet knowing I need to to sip.\\t\\tO: A huge huge beer with unbelievably complex flavors. I loved every second of this beer and I want to have more of this on a regular basis.\",\n",

Smelled pretty good, mild hints of mocha with a slight alcoholic tone. As for the taste, the best word to describe it is just.. wow.. Mocha and caramel fading to mild coffee flavors so powerful and pronounced that it's rather high ABV is not very pronounced. Mouthfeel was thick and rich, characteristic of Porters, much like a meal in a glass. This is a very very drinkable brew, and can hit you VERY hard if you're not careful. \\t\\tOverall, this is an absolutely wonderful brew i would recommend to pretty much everybody.\",\n",

The wonderful crown of toasted beige has a moonscape surface and is sticky enough so that sections maintain contact with the glass as it drops. Thick lace remains behind and resembles paint that was daubed on with a sponge.\\t\\tThe nose is pretty good as well, although I can't say that I love it. It consists of a near equal mix of melted caramel and fruity hops. I prefer hop-dominant noses, but can easily concede the point that ESBs should be more balanced. For some reason, I was afraid the English hops would get lost in the mix, but they manage to hold their own.\\t\\tIf only the flavor matched the rather modest bar set by the aroma. Unfortunately, the Scarlet Lady is something of a looker, but is shallow and bland underneath it all. I'm unimpressed by the amount and the quality of the flavor delivered by the malt. It's lightly caramel-like with an overly sweetened tea flavor.\\t\\tIt looks like my fears of a less than stellar hoppiness have been realized after all. Minimal hop flavor coupled with minimal hop bitterness is not a recipe for success for any ESB that I've ever had. It tastes like there are the outlines of a good flavor profile in here somewhere, but they haven't been filled in with anything substantial. Has the Lady been dumbed down or was she never that bright to begin with?\\t\\tThe finish is surprisingly long and allows at least some hop flavor to be appreciated. It's too little too late though. I have no complaints about the mouthfeel. It's medium for the style and is pleasantly smooth, modestly carbonated and clean. This is an easy drinking beer, I just wish that it was more interesting.\\t\\tUnfortunately, this isn't one of Stoudt's better offerings. An infusion of hops is the obvious fix. If nothing else, that would put some much needed 'B' in this ESB. As is, the Scarlet Lady isn't worth a one night stand, much less a prolonged affair.\",\n",

Big hoppy citrus oils and a nice spicy bite. Crisp piny scent in the background. Malts are restricted to a syrup sweetness. Just a bit of alcohol.\\t\\tT/M: Spicy grapefruit esters and a pine needle snap. Malts rush in with a creamy sweetness. Super dry finish with a lasting bitterness that has a nice, slightly less tart, grapefruit surprise. Alcohol comes through some more as it warms.\\t\\tD: Very tasty yet very bitter. If your a hophead, you'll love this. 2-3 max.\",\n",

The head was medium-sized, but it kept well. The scent was almost lemon-y, which was pleasant. It smelled like it was a pretty light beer. And that is what it turned out to be. It wasn't overly carbonated, making it easy to get down. It had a slight bitterness to the aftertaste, which was fine with me. Surprisingly, the beer also had a bit of a lime character in the taste. The mouthfeel was a pretty good balance. It wasn't too heavy, and it wasn't too light. I think this would be a good beer to drink while watching the ballgame or sitting around the TV.

Smell is thick, strong coffee/chocolate fudge with a leafy presence. Flavor has a great burnt edge and alcohol presence to give it zip and some depth (which is good, because the yeast seems to add no other depth to this). Thin silky body goes down very easily and pleasingly at first, but the coffee-twang in the finish grew tiring for me, hindering the drinkability. Throughout, a vanilla nougat flavor shines. I don't know...it is a cool beer, but after half the bottle is gone some of the flavors grate on me a little. Nice, but strikes me as a bit of a novelty without too much enjoyable drinking potential. (Am I wrong? Let me know if you really drink this regularly) It gave me a headache. I should have expected it considering the strange amount of alcohol presence for an 8% brew.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Sampled February 2010\\tA vigorous pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces an almost four-finger thick, richly browned head. The beer is very dark, almost perfectly black color that is quite opaque when held up to the light. The head manages to leave some spotty lacing on the sides of the glass as the head subsides. The aroma smells of vanillin and sweetened toasted coconut up front. This leads into a richly toasted malt character that leans towards barley husk notes, sweetened dark cocoa, and a cream laden, sweetened, French roast coffee drink. Interestingly enough this beer is not nearly as complex as I expected from a Bourbon Barrel aged Imperial Stout; I do like that this is very smooth and well integrated as the Bourbon character has not run rough-shod and hot over the aromatic profile.\\t\\tThe beer tastes quite sweet up front and finishes with a touch of Bourbon spice, acrid burnt malt, and a spicy carbonic bite that is a bit unexpected given that this isn't highly carbonated. Flavors of vanillin interweave with rich toasted coconut notes and the dark, chocolate like malt character to make this seem quite a bit like a rich desert. The body is rich and viscous as it lingers fatly on the palate without being cloying. As the beer warms up it loses some of the sweetness that was almost too much initially. This helps to bring out a rich, savory malt character that brings out a sort of salty, sort of smoky, definitely umami character.\\t\\tA quite enjoyable beer whose biggest flaw is that it is perhaps a bit simplistic. This definitely needs to be drunk on the warm side of cool where the savory quality becomes noticed and helps to boost the complexity. The most pleasant part of this beer is that it doesn't get overwhelmed by the Bourbon Barrel aging, which is a huge relief to me.\",\n",

Even with a hard pour there was not much head and what head it had disappeared quick. The lace was a thin line of tan head. The taste is not like any wheat beer that I have ever drank before. It is like a dunkel, eisbock rauch beer rolled in to one. It is also scotch like too. The smokiness hits you first then it is like a double bock. There is not much fizz to the body.

There are also some faint hints of toasted malt and some stronger caramel / toffee character. The mouthfeel is good.

The buff colored crown is nice looking and suggests quality brewing (here's hoping the rest of the beer follows suit). It's firm enough to maintain its structure for more than several minutes and leaves a respectable amount of lace in no particular pattern.\\t\\tTmavy Lezak smells like a garden variety Euro dark lager, although better than most. It is, at once, fruity and lightly caramel-like, with neither characteristic really overwhelming the other. Thankfully, I can appreciate very little of that stale mustiness that seems to emanate from the vast majority of EPLs and EDLs.\\t\\tThe flavor is flatter and less interesting than the aroma. While semi-interesting in the nose, it becomes 'beer by the numbers' on the palate. All style elements are in place, but the goods aren't delivered with enough panache. Many Euro dark lagers taste artificially flavored to me, as if the brewers used dark caramel syrup or extract to achieve the desired flavors rather than actual barley malt. This one tastes a little like that, although not horribly so.\\t\\tThe flavor profile consists of dark caramel, toasted nuts, mild cocoa and, again, the barest suggestion of musty hops. Sweet and bitter are both in the house, but neither one of them tries very hard. The mouthfeel is appropriate for the style and doesn't stand out in any way. A little more carbonation would add mouth interest since the flavor is so lacking in it.\\t\\tFerdinand Tmavy Lezak was beginning to make inroads against my dissatisfaction with the EDL style... until the all-important taste test. While far from horrible, it's yet another sub-par Czech beer that I can easily do without and will forget as soon as I toss the bottle into my recycling bin.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Poured from bottle into tulip. Appearance is dark amber color with light, beige head. Aroma is of malty sweetness, toffee, dark fruits, and a slight boozy-ness. Taste is complex - it started off with a heavy character of toasted malts, sweet bread, and caramel. As the it warmed up, there was more and more strong dark fruit flavors especially plum, which combined with the alcohol gave it a somewhat boozy quality. As my palate grew more accustomed to the heavy malt bill, I noticed more of the subtle hop bitterness that was lying underneath. Palate was full-bodied, thick in texture sitting heavy in the mouth, light and soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Not my choice from one of my favorite breweries, Founders.',\n",

High IBU\\'s balanced against malt & rye....nice.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Smooth and slightly chewy. Carbonation is spot on.\\t\\tDrinkability: This is an outstanding beer in my book. The balance is so well done that these go down too easy. Alcohol is not ever noticed and 1 beer went down in 4-5 gulps. Delicious and drinkable.\\t\\tOverall: I\\'ve already said it.

A lot of lacing remaining on the pint glass. \\t\\tS - Like a porter should smell ... I had expected a little more of the \"smoky\" aroma up front though. Smelled very good, but a little non-descript. \\t\\tT - Wow, the aroma doesn\\'t give away the smoky flavor in this beer. It\\'s quite pronounced. Rich and thick ... very earthy too. Woody notes with thick, \"outdoors\" type smoke character ... like this was smoked over oak leaves or something. The smoke flavor is a bit of a shock to the senses at first, but it\\'s pleasant and intruiging. This beer is pretty well balanced, and you can taste some hop flavor amid the dark, smoked malt. \\t\\tM - Pretty thick and heavy, but in a good way. Well-balanced mouthfeel. The smoky tatse leaves a residual effect in the mouth ... kind of like breathing in a bonfire\\'s smoke. Again, really intruiging. \\t\\tD - This beer could easily be offensive with it\\'s strong flavors, but it\\'s not. In fact, I\\'d say it\\'s really quite drinkable. I\\'d have another, and probably will the next time I get a chance. If you like Porters, you\\'ll like this one. If you like smoked porters, you\\'ll really like this one.

I was lucky to get the last of the stock of this great Kloster- made dopple for the year (or possibly ever) shipped to the government liquor store.\\tThe pour was a clear but dark cola-red color with medium effervescence and a rocky frothy tan head that reduces to a capping lace. Strong aromas of hazel nut brittle, fruit preserves and a hint of cinnamon. Starts very rich...silky-oily mouth feel with a massive malt wallop...sweetness pervades in the rich malty body with distinct notes of burnt toffee, some berry and spice mingled with the very rich malts ( the hops at this point sit in the background preventing this from tasting overly sweet). The finish is beautifully lazy as the big malts and sweet spiciness mutate on the tongue to a more complex mix and the hops make this a semi sweet finish like raw bakers chocolate with fruit and nuts in it.. then the lingering after taste leaves the metallic hops on the back of your tongue to mingle with a detectable \"warming\". A superbly complex and well crafted dopplebock. I have the last of this to come in cellared but I wonder how long that will last when the nights turn cold and the venison comes out of the freezer.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"12oz hand bottle from a growler. Initially, the aroma was all spent coffee grounds. But as the beer warms, that subsides and actually balances out rather well. Dark chocolate, some wet leather, plenty of coffee. Charred sugar (I'm guessing it's the maple?). Plenty of wood tannin. Some charred oak. Surprisingly, for being only 9.4%, the alcohol shows itself rather prominently. Chocolate, roasted malt and coffee seem to be the dominant aromas here. Pours the requisite thick, oily black with a dark, rich, khaki head. I'm not quite as taken with the flavor as I was with the aroma. There is a lot of fusel alcohol. Charred wood, alcohol soaked vanilla bean, coffee grounds, bitter, dark chocolate. The alcohol really cuts through all of the flavors though. Maybe some Kahlua infused creme-brulee. Little to no maple detected on the palate. Velvety texture. Fairly silky initially but becomes a bit more aggressive toward the finish. Mostly full bodied. Slightly greasy. Boozy and astringent finish. A better than average Coffee Imperial Stout. Would be better if the alcohol were masked some, though. Thanks a ton for this one Zac! You 'da man!\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"500 mL German bottle. The guy at Wine Warehouse told me they brew this as a regular Helles lager, but because they use the same equipment to package the beer, some of the smoky qualities of their rauchbiers inadvertently end up in this beer. Not sure if it's true, but it would make sense. Anyway, it pours into the pilsner glass a clear yellow/gold with a 1 finger head that reduces to a thick and creamy layer of foam that sticks quite well. The aroma consists of toasty, pale malts with a faint smokiness and a mild dose of spicy hops. It is initially quite crisp with a medium body, but the carbonation evens out and the flavor follows what the scent hinted at. It's pretty tasty and the faint smoke adds an interesting twist to this German lager.\",\n",

There are hints of both vanilla and roasted chocolate. This is a fairly smooth beer, but the alcohol is astringent on the palate.

The bottle has a thick layer of dust and some foreign junk stuck to the outside bottom of the bottle.\\t\\tPoured hard into my imperial pint glass and it fit perfectly with a tall but short lived tan, big-bubbled head. I already can smell smoke from a distance. It smells awful sweet and smoky. Actually I get chocolate in the nose too. The beer itself is a dark brown with brown tints at the edges. As you bring the beer to your lips, you're nose is forced to inhale the smoky aroma. It's not cigarette smoke thank goodness, but more like some kind of aromatic wood. I don't get floral hops. It's a real gorgeous smell I can't quite make out. It's really quite intoxicating. I finally looked it up, and Michael Jackson says it's beechwood... Whatever. The taste is actually sweet and syrupy, balanced with more of the same smokiness, which really comes off as a roasted flavor except there is almost no astringency. My tongue met the smoke and said, ok now give me some burnt astringency and it never came. At first I missed that burnt taste but after more sips, it really works. The smokiness lasts a long time and comes to a medium dry finish -- enough to clear out the sweet but no puckering. Compared to porters and stouts it's on the thin side, light to medium bodied. But I think they must make it that way because the smokiness isn't bitter/astringent enough to fight too much malt. I felt the alcohol in my head before I felt it on my tongue. \\t\\tWow this beer is unlike anything I've ever had. And I like it alot. If you like beers with roasted flavor and aroma, but you don't like the atringency that burnt grains bring, you must try this one.\\t\\tHmmm... as I get to the bottom of the glass, it does seem a little more astringent. The smoke seems to get stronger with every taste. I can see why this isn't such a good everyday beer.\",\n",

Smells like a Russian Imperial, good job.\\t\\tTaste is really strong. Medium body (not as thick as I expected) and there is a strong alvalache of roast flavor in the back of the mouth. Strong coffee taste almost makes the beer crunchy. I can taste the alcohol (I believe this was bottled in 2009 but I can't say for sure). Overall its a very big stout. Strong and flavorful. Its all a little much to take in at once. I did enjoy this beer. The flavors skew toward the sweet as the beer warms.\",\n",

Taste is more and more rich dark chocolate, roasted coffee and creamy, milky oatmeal with a slight hop note at the end. More like a dessert than a breakfast. Incredibly intense, intricate, and complex both on the nose and the palate. A real work of art. WOW. Amazing stuff here. Alcohol comes out a little more as it warms and in turn warms your belly. Mouthfeel is heavy and well-carbonated for a stout. Probably couldn't drink more than two of these, based on the heaviness and the 8.3% abv, but I don't want to stop. Just an outstanding beer here. Highly recommended to any stout lover. Easily lived up to the hype.\",\n",

The pour produced a hazy deep reddish brown beer, with an inch or so of creamy off white head and no visible carbonation. The smell on the other hand was not impressive at all, a slight malt sweetness is barely discernable if anything. The taste is also quite bland, there really seems to not having much going on with this brew. You could taste some malt sweetness, and very little bittering hops, but its all so subdued that the beer seems like it has no character whatsoever. On the positive side however i really enjoyed the mouthfeel, its creamy, and very smooth. Given the right taste the mouthfeel could promote pretty good drinkability, but as it as, the beer is just too bland for me to want to down more than one. Overall, im not very impressed and its unlikely that i'll pick this one up again.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"2011 12oz. bottle poured into a Bells tulip glass\\t\\tIt pours a nearly pitch black with a 1 finger head rising from the depths of the beer. Retention is medium and a minimal amount of lacing lines the glass. Impressive head formation and retention for a 11%+ beer\\t\\tThe nose is a hodgepodge of sweet bourbon, chocolate and roasted coffee. The coffee and chocolate fade towards the end and a little nose hair tingling alcohol aroma wafts up.\\t\\tIn the taste the chocolate isn't as present but up front a medium strong roasted coffee. The barreling then becomes very evident with a strong dose of vanilla and then a nice smooth bourbon taste. The finish is a hint too strong in the alcohol burn down the throat, but I'm sure that'll age out.\\t\\tThe body seems very thinned out by the bourbon, not thick and viscous in the least. Carbonation is medium low. There is also the alcohol burn previously mentioned. I really just prefer more body in an Imperial Stout.\\t\\tI've had this a number of times and am just getting around to reviewing it. While I do like this beer and think it's great, it's just never been world class to me.\",\n",

The malts for the most part stay in the background in terms of sweetness levels, but they do a good job of cutting the initial bitterness.

Nutty and toast malt flavors with a clean bready biscuit malt backbone. Balanced just slightly to the bitter with some earthy hop flavor coming through. I think it has lost some of it's freshness, there is a touch of staleness to the malt and a bit of lemony tea to the hop profile.

       "  'review/text': \"Wow, was surprised to see this at the beer store this afternoon! I was lazily making a mixed six pack and found these in the Founders shelf so I just had to throw one in there. Poured from the bottle into my Duvel tulip after chilling in the fridge for an hour or so.\\t\\tPours viscous with a one finger head that dissipates quickly. After the head is gone you are left with an outer rim of foam around the edges of the glass. The body of the beer is ruby red. Thin lacing as the beer is drank.\\t\\tThe smell is nuts. Lots of alcohol in the smell, it almost smells medicinal. The bourbony vanilla is dominant with the malts in the background.\\t\\tFirst sip is a bourbon and malty explosion. The alcohol is hot too. My palate began to numb after the second sip but the aftertaste was still there. Lots of bourbon in this one and some scotchy malts in the background. I wish I could have tried Dirty Bastard before this one to have a familiarity with the beer before I tasted it bourbon barrel aged. Maybe I would have gotten more out of the taste. Overall, the taste is much like it smells. I think it'll taste better with some age on it due to it being so hot right now.\\t\\tMouthfeel is alright. Kind of on the thinner side of a scotch ale with minimal carbonation. The etching on this glass helps keep the bubbles going but not much. Still a good feeling to swish it around your mouth but not excellent by any means.\\t\\tDrinkability is fair. I'm not too big on bourbon bombs and this one appears to be so in its youth. Maybe with 6 months or so on it, it'll be more palatable and drinkable to me. Overall though, a good beer.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Notes from 5/9/10\\t\\tA new brew at Founders, I have to try it. SZRP of Doom is their Hand of Doom DIPA aged in maple barrels.\\t\\tFounders poured this into a snifter for me. The color is a golden yellow orange with minimal lacing. There is virtually no head but a rim of white that gathers around the edges.\\t\\tA hint of maple is prevalent in the scent with some alcohol esters. There are a few citrus notes hidden behind the maple, mostly pineapple. The most interesting thing I notice in the smell is a scent of marshmallow cream. I'm not sure if this is created from the maple combining with the malts, but it is a unique character.\\t\\tThe maple oak flavor really mellows the front end of the taste making it rich and creamy. The back end provides a mild DIPA punch with ample malts and a grassy bitterness. The balance is exceptional. It is amazing how the maple barrel masks the hops and blends with the other flavors. Typically, one does not think of maple in combination of an otherwise citrusy beer, but they found a way to make it work. Overall this is an improvement on Hand of Doom in my opinion.\\t\\tThe mouthfeel is creamy with a medium body. I've never had a double IPA that is so smooth.\\t\\tThis is very very drinkable. It has the drinkability of a creamy smooth single IPA, very dangerous. 5 of these would be easy to consume and then I'd be doomed. \\t\\tBottle this please!\",\n",

Not really bubbly lack of carbonation is pretty evident. \\t\\tSmell: Dark chocolate, and coffee bean. You put the glass down and you can still smell it. \\t\\tTaste: Tastes like it smells, f'n good. Why it is hard to rate it a notch more is maybe the lack of carbonation but really mouth and taste sometimes go hand in hand. \\t\\tMouth: This beer is lightly carbonated, doesn't mean it is bad. It is not that hard to swallow and crisp taste just really sticks to you.\\t\\tOverall: Put on your seatbelts and grab yourself your favorite beer glass and indulge in one of the finest beers period. Not full of bubble but full of crisp fresh and might I add incredible flavor. If there is one not I would do is maybe slightly more carbonated....screw it, it tastes excellent. Cheers to all!\",\n",

       "  'review/text': '200ml bottle from appx. May 2007. \\tReviewed Feb 2009.\\tGood to very good cellaring conditions and based on the other reviews, I certainly don\\'t think this has set too long.\\t\\tRecommended glassware: Wine glass or tapered snifter.\\t\\tPopping the cap reveals only the slightest puff of carbonation. Some very light activity upon the pour, a thin head fades very quickly, even with a vigorous pour. Some yeast slurry remains stuck to bottom of bottle.\\t\\tNose is noticeably alcoholic with many rose wine or mead-like qualities. Stem fruit like pear and apple very prominent.\\t\\tTaste is also apparently alcoholic and a heavy malt asserts itself. Good bit of residual sweetness with a twang of alcohol. Aftertaste has an interesting carmel flavor. Candied apples is a good way to describe it. Very low bitterness, almost undetectable.\\t\\tMouthfeel is heavy enough owing to the residual sugar but without any carbonation to open it up, it seems a bit underwhelming. Turbulating air through the teeth (as if tasting olive oil) can help open this brew up but still does little for the nose.\\t\\tDrinkability is acceptable to poor. After perhaps half of the contents, I don\\'t feel particularly compelled to finish it. A solid \"meh,\" it\\'s not terrible but nothing exemplary either. The meadlike qualities are nice (for those of us who like still mead) but there\\'s not really much to keep you coming back to it. To be honest, I\\'d rather just drink mead.\\t\\tDrink if you get a chance (it\\'s worth knowing what\\'s out there) but don\\'t spend too much time or energy looking for it.',\n",

The aromas came roiling out of the goblet before I even got my nose close: strong caramel and dark fruit notes, a vinous aroma and a slightly smoky malt scent all crowded around. Tasting it, I realized I had picked the right beer for the night. Up front was a hefty fruity sweetness composed of prunes and plums and their smaller cousins, raisins and grapes. A hearty malt base bucked up against the competing toffee and caramel sweetness. The finish yielded a sherry-esque alcohol flavor with an increasing hops bittering that lingered quite a while. Complex, yet well blended. The feel was full, round, and possessing a silken creaminess.\\tOverall, this was a nice, easily drinkable doppelbock. Tasty and smooth; one of the more hoppy d-bocks I've had and pretty darn enjoyable.\",\n",

Beer is a pretty nice black, not brown with some floating bits throughout. Not so much to be offended just a bit of yeast bits. The head has no distinct lacing it just slowly turns to a mild ring.\\t\\tS - Has some slight bourbon characteristics which consist of vanilla, a bit of oak, and some raisin and dark fruits from the quad side. Doesn't smell offending so I guess it's not infected.\\t\\tT - Here the biggie. Wow it's surprisingly watery but I do get notes of bourbon (slightly) with a touch of vanilla that turns to a plum maybe cherries, which is kind of bitter and lactic. It then turns to a roast side with a bit of smoke and finishes with a bitter twang that leaves a soapy feeling on the tongue.\\t\\tM - I really wanted more body for this with a ABV of almost 12 percent but it drinks too watery with only a slight bit of burning as it hits the stomach. Watery.\\t\\tOverall I could see why this doesn't have any reviews. Mostly one dimensional with no real bourbon flavors, watery, and with a mild sour lactic tone of cherry was kind of off putting. Still it was worth a try to have my first bourbon barrel aged Quad.\",\n",

As you sip, it does leave a few stretch marks of foam and some blobs of lace, however. All in all, not the best looking beer, but it\\'s not bad.\\t\\tAroma: Pine and lighter citrus are the most prominent hop notes here, floating on top of an array of dark, toasted malts, faintly smelling of coffee and faintly of bready, well-done toast.\\t\\tTaste: Stone 11th-like - that is, it\\'s a dark, toasty, piney, west coast DIPA. Fairly heavily roasted coffee with a few stray bitter astringencies, slight milkyness, a moderate amount of bitterness, and lots of citrus zest and pine. Hops are slightly soapy, unfortunately, but overall it\\'s really good.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium bodied, though well on the road to thick, with plenty of carbonation, resulting in a slightly uneven brew. The crispness is sort of muted, as well.\\t\\tDrinkability: Well-hidden alcohol, if nothing else. The flavors are pleasant, and if the hop schedule and carbonation were to be altered slightly, this would be a really solid beer.',\n",

A very small tan head sits at the surface until the end, leaving a nice lace on the glass for an imperial stout. Looks great, but I've seen some that look much more intimidating. Impressive overall.\\t\\tS - Sweetness in the form of vanilla and maple syrup, notes of coffee and chocolate, and of course I get a good bit of bourbon. Nowhere near what I smell with KBS, which is a good thing for me, but the alcohol is alive in the aroma here. Extremely pleasant overall.\\t\\tT - I get a strong maple coffee flavor up front, mixed with some chocolate and fairly notable bourbon flavor (again, nothing close to the bourbon in KBS, so I'm excited for the rest of this one). This is a pretty darn sweet brew, but that didn't stop me from having multiple glasses. I guess I should expect a lot of sweetness in a BS. I preferred this one as it warmed since it was initially served a bit too cold. The flavors really explode and blend nicely to create possibly the best stout I've tasted to date. This brew was somewhat warming, but that doesn't surprise me at all. Taste is off the charts, overall.\\t\\tM - Not as thick and chewy as I would have guessed (that's a plus), almost thin for an imperial stout, but very smooth. I feel like the carbonation is spot on... There isn't too much at all, which is how I like my heavy stouts.\\t\\tD - Well I had no issue downing 30 oz. of this delicious beer during happy hour so I'd say it's a heck of a drinkable beer for what it is. You wouldn't want to slam them all night or else you'd probably get sick, and you wallet would be empty (rightfully so). It's a beer that you'll rarely have a chance to try. If you see this on tap, pick up a glass, and don't be hesitant to order another. By the way, I DEFINITELY prefer this to KBS. Much more pleasant and I don't get the liquor and heat that I got from KBS.\",\n",

Even though very little lace graced the glass in the end, the beer did look pretty good in a balloon snifter. $5 for an 8 ounce pour.\\t\\tAs it happened, aroma was the beer's best feature. It was impressively hoppy, with loads of pineapple, orange and lemon that was powerfully pungent. Alcohol was barely noted, which was yet another plus. Simcoe was a no-brainer. The bartender (after talking with the brewer) stated that Amarillo and Summit are the other members of the hop bill.\\t\\tFor whatever reason, hops were much less prominent on the palate and alcohol was more prominent. The ale smoothed out a little over time (it was served too cold), but hop flavor never did increase, as I'd hoped it would. Call me crazy, but a DIPA named Hand Of Doom ought to pummel the tongue in merciless fashion.\\t\\tNothing darker than sugary pale malt was appreciated. Flavors otherwise included candied grapefruit, pineapple, orange and lemon. Unfortunately, flavor intensity left quite a bit to be desired. The alcohol wasn't as well-masked as it should have been. It added a solvent-like flavor and was warm enough to begin numbing the tongue by the bottom half of the glass. \\t\\tThe body/mouthfeel was a fraction lighter than medium for the style and was as smooth as possible given the rampant ethanol. Lightly sparkly bubbles added just the right amount of lift.\\t\\tGiven the rest of the Founders lineup (including the outstanding Double Trouble), Hand Of Doom is a disappointing effort. An American DIPA that doesn't taste very hoppy isn't much of an American DIPA. It's as simple as that.\",\n",

Deniz may have cried, I'm not sure...\\t\\tSits a thick, seal-brown body in the tasting glass, letting in a little light at the edges to take on a mahogany hue. A fat custard head floats aimlessly atop, unaware of the deliciousness lurking beneath. Excellent nose on this RIS, as the oak-aging adds an intoxicating vanilla profile that complements well the espresso coffee and dark chocolate. \\t\\tToo many flavorical (I just made that up) nuances to count. Chocolate, bourbon, immensely fruity tastes of blackberry and raisin...spiced wood, charcoal...the list goes on. This could have easily been a cluster-fuck of flavors, but everything is so well balanced in this beer that they all achieve a zen-like harmony across every part of the palate. Mouthfeel is no slouch, either. A hint of heat from the booze compliments a perfect carbonation level and a medium-thick body. I can feel my stomach warming with every sip. Bravo to Hoppin' Frog---I repeat: BRAVO! I thought regular old B.O.R.I.S. was amazing (and, rightfully so, it still is) but the Barrel-Aged version takes it to a whole 'nother level.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Presentation: 12 oz bottle purchased in Aug 05 at Founders in Grand Rapids. No freshness dating.\\t\\tAppearance: Dark cherry red that glows brightly when backlit. With a vigorous pour a clean white head develops that takes on a pinkish look because of the red beer beneath it. The head has moderate retention and it thins to sticky clumps of islands and lace. Light swirling revives a smooth and uniform head made up of only the smallest white bubbles. The head is sticky on the sides and leaves a tight lacy coating on the sides.\\t\\tSmell: Strong raspberry nose with lots of candy sugar sweetness in the fruit. Some grainy seed or rye scent sits around the raspberry smell.\\t\\tTaste: Tangy sweet flavor much like raspberry jam up front. Considering the nose on this beer it is surprisingly diverse in the flavors it offers. Along with the raspberry is a full maltiness in the middle. The chewy malt lasts into the last third of the beer. The end lets a tiny cluster of earthy and leafy hop bitterness burst out into the sweetness. This is nice change and without it the beer would approach cloying with all of its sweetness.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Grainy, sticky, and syrupy. It has the feel of sugar dissolved in water with a spoonful of raspberry jam mixed in. Tasty, but it feels more like fruit punch gatorade than beer on my palate.\\t\\tDrinkability: Despite the not-so-great mouthfeel this beer is very drinkable. It is sweet and fruity with some hop to balance out the mad sweetness. I'd recommend trying it at the very least. It make a good dessert beer all by itself.\",\n",

Lingering aftertaste of espresso mingled with alcohol and oak character that brings forward some previously missed vanilla sweetness through the finish with dark roasty grain character. As it warms, the bourbon notes really come forward with an increased vanilla scent and taste. Minor notes of earthiness and must are also detected along with a slight mineral presence. Quite a deep and complex brew there are indications of some herbal hop bitterness but that gets dominated by the roasty grain bitterness.\\t\\tMedium to full in the feel with a modest level of carbonation. Quite a drinkable sipper that would be fantastic on a cold evening or as a morning \"pick me up.\" Overall I was quite surprised by how much coffee character this brew has. I look forward to having it again when some of that coffee drops off and the bold alcohol mellows out a bit.',\n",

Simple, bready, slight musty yeast undertone. A dilute, bland, pecan like impression surfaces as the beer breathes. Comparatively lightly bodied for style, but with adequate dextrins for a gentle, smooth mouthfeel once the initial carbonic bite diminishes.

The aftertaste is sweet and satisfying with hints of toffee. No alcohol burn at all. You can only sense the 8% after you've had a pint. This is a MUST TRY if you live within a few hours of Anacapa.

This is one of those times.\\t\\ta - black, rich, small dark head, leaves a ring of imperial lacing\\ts - the smell is like a morning cup of coffee or maybe a sweet burnt chocolate treat, call it what you like, it has a nose strong of coffee, chocolate, malty, and molasses. Very nice, pleasant and mouth watering.\\tt - exceeds the nose. Delicious blend of chocolate, coffee, molasses, brown sugar, cream and so smooth and creamy. Top notch.\\tm - mouthfeel is great! It's much like the taste - creamy, sticky, but not bitter or sweet, just flavorful - you WANT this to linger.\\td - drinkabily is as good as the taste which is already hard to improve on. It's sessionable, drinkable, and with the right amount of carbonation\\t\\tFor me personally, I'm declaring this THE stout to taste in 2011. Hard to improve on what is already right. Elements can make a drink different but in this case, not better IMO. There may be some that find this to be a bit sweet, maybe a little too coffeeish... but to this reviewer, only keeping this on hand year round for a treat would be the goal. I love this stout.\\t\\tedit: I stand by this review although I have now become intoxicated with this stout.\",\n",

Some sort of mild funk at the end for sure, though whether urine is the best descriptor I cannot say.\\t\\tWhile Founders tends to make flavor-forward beers, this one was quite a bit more laid back. Has the light taste of a typical cream ale, backed with a not inconsiderable bit of apple. Sadly, the apple is not especially tart nor especially sweet. It is just there. Doesn't seem to add much. But it mostly obscures the bourbon, and in doing so mellows out too much. Slightly bitter aftertaste, though not clearly attributable to any of the above elements, nor to hops, which seemed not to get so much as a cameo role here.\\t\\tMuch as I love Founders, this is a sub-par effort on their part. The name hooked me, as it seemed a rather ambition and original proposition. But the combo didn't work well, as the end result was a somewhat off-tasting blend of elements that served to obscure one another. It was easy enough to drink, but I can't see myself having it again.\",\n",

The first aroma is strong black coffee. As the beer warmed to room temperature, I got more of a chocolate smell but coffee was always the main aroma. The taste is expectedly black coffee, easily the most coffee-filled beer I have ever drank. You never get too much chocolate flavor, but you get bitterness from the chocolate which is nice. The oatmeal comes through in the mouthfeel, making the beer very thick and creamy. Very good beer, one of the best I have ever drank.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"On nitro-tap at the brewery the day after DLD. What I am told is that the grain bill for the Breakfast and KBS are so massive that they re-use the same grains for this beer. It is a simple roasty session beer more similar to any other Irish Dry Stout that you'd get on Nitro-tap. I didn't find much resembling oatmeal in this beer. Yes maybe a hint, but I think you will be less disappointed if you simply consider this an Irish dry Stout. That is just my opinion.\\t\\tAppearance: is perfect!!! Of course the nitro makes that happen but is a gorgeous pour with excellent cascading carbonation and a head that continues to grow and form even after the beer is set in front of me. The head lasts almost the entire duration of the beer and the lacing is big chucky foam spot pasted to the glass none other.\\t\\tSmell: Where did it go. As beautiful as the beer sitting here is... where did the big beautiful aroma go? After some searching, burying my nose in the beer I could faintly detect the roasty grains and suggestions of coffee but it is not aromatic like I would expect from a true Oatmeal Stout, or especially that of a monster oatmeal stout like Breakfast Stout. Clearly this is the left over. Oh well.\\t\\tTaste: Very roasty and dry. Roasty coffee and chocolate and mostly just dark grains and malt, some burnt cocoa as well.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Exceptionally smooth with the nitro. Nice body.\\t\\tDrinkability: As a Guinness fan in the past I reserve a special appreciation for a good sessionable stout. This one is comparable to a good beer in that style. \\t\\tHope this is helpful.\\tCheers!\",\n",

It is an earthy smell - warming, but without alcohol characteristics.\\t\\tThere is a crisp hoppy flavor, with moderate-to-low carbonation. The hops are intricately arranged - the result is a multi-dimensional flavor. There is a balancing sweetness. It includes a significant bitterness, but not as much as I've noticed in other double IPAs (or even some 'standard' IPAs). The finish brings out more of the bitterness, but also adds a creamy feel.

       "  'review/text': \"A= A basically flat beer.... I had the same problem with Bells 9000 last night but I think that one may have had even more carbonation than this. A vigerous pour unleashes a small thin head. So thin I can see the beer underneath it and it doesn't last more than a second before falling to nothing at all. No lacing from the no head. The color however is somewhat pleasent looking. A nice hazy amber color pushing a mahogony darker amber color.\\t\\tS= Not a lot of odor in this one either. Digging deep I get the bourbon in it. Founders has the best bourbon barrels I've ever had the pleasure of tasting beer from. The bourbon smell is just great with loads of vanilla in it and just a clean oak smell. Almost coconutty in the smell. Other than that though the smell is small. Prolly lacking from the lack of head on the beer. No maple which I was looking forward to.\\t\\tT= This beer goes up from here. Again the barrels that founders has are great. Nice vanilla oaky coconut flavors in it. Not nearly as hot as I was expecting either. A hint of alcohol burn and taste but not as much as I figured there would be. Mellowed nicely by the barrel notes. Great wheaty smoothness to it and the hop bite is right on as well. The hops are one of the biggest differences in this and Backwoods Bastard from them. Nice bitterness lasts on the back of the tongue. There is a small amount of maple in the taste I suppose but I might just be imagining it because I want to.\\t\\tM= No carbonation in this one... thick and chewy but not as much as I would have suspected from the lack of carbonation. The appearence does not do the mouthfeel justice. Much smoother and cleaner than the sticky mess it appeared to be.\\t\\tD= Awesome barrels at founders and a fine beer. Not what I was expecting when I read about the first Nemisis realease and this one is worth seeking out. The only problem I have with this beer is the lack of carbonation.\",\n",

A lot of malt flavor and smoke with just a touch of citrus. The hops never overcome the malt but it is noted. Bitterness is also fairly high. The body is robust and filling.

Jumped at it, I love Schlenkerla rauchbiers and this is the only one on the BA database (so far) I haven\\'t tried yet. Smoked oak instead of beech according to the label: \"The resulting Schlenkerla oak smoke malt has a smoother and more multi layered smoky note than the intensely aromatic beech smoke malt. The hence complex smokiness is paired with the multifaceted bitterness of finest Hallertau aroma hops\".\\t\\tIt pours a very clear copper color with a thin foam that dissipates quickly to a small poof and a ring. Strong campfire aromatics, cured meat, your usual smoked razzle dazzle. I do love rauchbiers but apparently my perception isn\\'t good enough to discern oak from beech, at least without a side-by-side. \\t\\tVery nice flavor, smooth up front with salty bacon and sweet malts, a little bitter in back with a lasting smoky presence. Hard to find the bock flavors, I guess the sweet malts can be attributed to the bock style though.\\t\\tEasy drinking, a very solid rauchbier. I\\'m gonna keep one for a Schlenkerla portfolio night, everything but the fastenbier (tap only).',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"served on-tap at Flying Saucer: Kansas City, MO, into a tulip glass\\t\\tPours what appears to be a jet black but scrutiny when held to light reveals it to be a very dark brown akin to the color of woodstain. 1/2 finger of lightly tan head forms with pretty soapy lacing that doesn't cling all that well.\\t\\tMake no mistake -- despite the bourbon this beer is still in the Breakfast Stout family. The coffee aromas coming out of the glass are enormous. BA member turamarth turned to me and said that it smells like a mocha. Yeah, pretty much. Lots of sweetness -- vanilla, oak, coffee-flavored candies. Not so much chocolate as just a sense of maltiness. The bourbon manifests itself subtly as a kiss of alcohol on the deep inhalations. I can haz candle plz?\\t\\tThere is a lot of unique things going on here wrt the taste. The coffee isn't as strong as the nose suggests and the bourbon is stronger than the nose suggests. The bourbon isn't hot or overwhelming; it just adds roundness and sweetness to what the roasted malts are already doing. There is a greater presence of dark fruits in this draught version of the beer than in the bottled incarnation. Light touches of green hickory wood and a vanilla/milk sweetness add dimension and dynamism. The toffee flavors here are much stronger than in the bottle. The draught KBS has a lot more of the barrel taste within it.\\t\\tMouthfeel is thicker on-tap than the 2010 bottled version. It still isn't super-thick but it is certainly thickER. It is supremely drinkable, relatively speaking. You are drawn, commanded, to further sips. And KBS is ever-so accommodating. The high ABV% of 11.2% keeps the score from being a 5.0\\t\\tKBS is slightly different on tap but no less delicious. Founders knows what the Hell to do with a stout, that's for sure.\",\n",

It had a small head that quickly settled into a thin collar and thin wisps. Good lacing but not much sticking. \\t\\tThe aroma was heavy on the caramel malt with lots of alcohol presence. Not much hop aroma which is surprising for a 3XIPA. Very disappointing. The taste had more of the hop flavor but again was very lacking for the style. Starts out very sweet and as that fades the alcohol shows up then that fades and a touch of moderately bitter hops hit at the end. Medium to full mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. Slightly bitter and alcoholish aftertaste. \\t\\tOverall, an average to good IPA that really disappointed. One of the few Founders misses for me. Way too sweet and the alcohol was too present. And it lacked hops! Not avail here in TX so got one during my Indy trip and shipped back. Rotation - if avail near me: I might try one again if I could get right after the release so the hops were at the freshest but other than that one is enough. [N;N]',\n",

First, although Pike\\'s literature describes this as \"unfiltered\" this 40% wheat beer shows an unexpected clarity. It is dilute oak color and undercarbonated with an eclipsed head and minimal lace. There\\'s no aroma to be found, but the flavor at first delivers a strong yet clean American ale yeast component with an inflated malt sweetness that overshadows all further attributes. The profuse sweetness borders on cloying and betrays any sense of identity as a wheat beer. The crisp dryness, fluffy body, or dense opacity more common to the style just isn\\'t here. \\t\\t\\tWeisse can still be enjoyed as a clean, if overly sweet ale.

It has a deep malty aroma, with heavy hints of citrus--almost like grapefruit. Also present is a tinge of caramel or chocolate. Tastewise, it has a malty, full-bodied flavor with a bit of a rye kick for a pleasant aftertaste. There are definite citrus flavors as well. Red's Rye is full, but smooth, and surprisingly easy to swallow, despite its being so sharp going down. Overall, I would say that this is a beer that is eminently enjoyable, but only when sipped slowly in order to understand its true complexity. Definitely worth drinking again and again....\",\n",

Well balanced into the end though.\\t\\tM. The mouthfeel is heavy and full as expected, but not thick. The promise was delivered exactly as expected.\\t\\tD.

Lots of molasses and brown sugar with a definite oak presence. The word I would use to describe it is rich. A blending of semidark fruits come through.\\t\\tT - Again, rich is the word. Taste is much better than the smell. Plenty of the molasses, much more than the sugar. Even with all the molasses flavor it's not extremely sweet - don't get me wrong, it's not dry, but it's not syrupy. The molasses backs a more fruity body that actually finishes much more dry than I expect. Oak is noticeable on the finish. This isn't as complex as Adam (my standard of comparison for the style) but is extremely tasty and remarkably easy to drink for what it is.\\t\\tM - Excellent. The carbonation is very low but present. Alcohol not noticeable. The sweet and molasses feel doesn't come through as syrupy. Excellent feel for this one.\\t\\tExcellent beer. I've had this before but usually fresh, and this is notably smoother and richer after only one year. Great offering from Founders, only lacking in that it lacks some of the complexity of the giants of the style, but still well worth seeking out.\",\n",

There were way too may great beers at this event to even begin taking any notes, but this beer was so memorable, I feel OK doing a review. This was generously provided by Matt C., the owner of Capone's.\\t\\tThe beer pours the expected blackish brown color with very good head retention and lot of sticky lacing all around. The beer smells every bit as good as it looks, with a considerable amount of coffee, choclate, black cherry, vanilla and maple syrup. Flavors replicate the nose almost exactly, but what really sets this beer apart is the mouthfeel. This beer is almost viscuous, and just has a lovely, crowd pleasing richness about it. This beer is so smooth and long, and the flavor is just mouth coating. Drinkability is stupid good. You can pretty much tell the alcohol is up there, but there is so much sweet, decadent creamy goodness, that you hardly even notice the alcohol. \\t\\tMatt mentioned that this beer reminds him of a somewhat less rich version of CBS, and I would have to agree. This is a beer I will always order whenever I'm lucky enough to see it on tap. Just delicious.\",\n",

It left one of the strangest Belgian laces I have ever seen - it was broken up into different segments of different types of lacing. Layered in some parts, speckled in others. Perhaps it was more to do with my glass than anything else. The aroma was disappointing in the sense there was none. Try as I might, I was left sniffing like a clown while I couldn\\'t discern a single aroma. Perhaps the faintest of faintest flowery hops, but that may have been my imagination. The taste, while being a little bitter, could only be described as \"interesting\". Very bitter in the beginning which isn\\'t such a bad thing, unless as the case was here in that the malt did not balance it at all. The hops seemed to impart a decent flavour though, so it wasn\\'t a total lost cause. The mouthfeel was fine and while the taste was unbalanced, the drinkability wasn\\'t too bad. Not a bad brew to try, but I couldn\\'t help but be a little disappointed.',\n",

Minor lacing.\\t\\tWorked a bit to get the smell going (temperature), but was primarily a roasted espresso, and a touch of sweetness - bittersweet chocolate and vanilla. \\t\\tTaste was much more pronouced than the smell, and the roasted malt and espresso qualities dominated, without being the least bit bitter. The sweet maple flavor was tame, but you can tell it really helps level things out. I guess I was expecting \"more waffle, less coffee\", but the reverse worked well.\\t\\tMF started very creamy smooth - like a goose-down pillow in a glass, and then puts the breaks on gently with a slightly acridic bite. This aspect was the real winner for me here. \\t\\tVery, very drinkable - in fact, I continued with two other imperial stouts after this one.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Old Spice does not come in a Red Can, but it does smell nice. It is the Christmas Beer from Fernandes Brewery, produced for the last 3 years in small, but nonetheless, highly sought after quantities. I am told by the Brewer, it is loosely based on the regularly produced beer, Double-Six, but that it has additional \"Spices\" and even Rum, plus other \\'secret\\' ingredients, that may alter slightly year-on-year. Boy, this is one hell of a Christmas Beer. It is usually made several months before the festive season, and stronger than 6% ABV by the time it is sold I suspect (just don\\'t tell the Tax Man). Drink it by the real fire in the Brewery Tap and defrost as it fights the English Winter cold better than Spartcus fought the Romans. It warms as it traverses the throat, and it kicks the heart when it gets there. It\\'s for sipping and not supping  - so you may struggle to drink more than say, a couple of half-pints of this though. I am sure Father Christmas has this in his Hip-Flask when he leaves home.',\n",

Served at cellar temperature, 45 degrees F.\\t\\tA fairly delicate pour produces a deep copper-amber-tinged brew with a half-fingered head of off-white (leaning on beige) foam that recedes somewhat quickly before resting into a thin crown that leaves behind some light, splotchy lacing on the walls of the glass.\\t\\tSome barrel aging is evident in the nose, as notes of vanilla and a hint of coconut mingle with sweet caramel and a whiff of alcohol as the beer warms.\\t\\tMedium-full in body with a very light carbonation, the mouthfeel is neither thin nor heavy. Though some sweet caramel notes appear up front, at temperatures of 45 degrees F and up the middle is immediately taken over by a very bitter, resiny hop-and-alcohol character that is a bit overpowering. Mingling within are notes of oak, vanilla and burnt sugar, but the astringent nature of the middle is somewhat off-putting and carries through well into the finish with an almost solventy nature. The finish is extremely dry and displays more oak barrel notes of vanilla and woodiness.\\t\\tI'm not sure if it's the temperature or if this is just a bad bottle, but the strong hoppy/solventy nature in the middle is quite overpowering and makes this a little bit of a chore to drink. It is reminiscent of Nemesis 2009, but in a bad way, as the barrel aging notes and the base character of the beer are a bit similar, but the strength of flavor that, with Nemesis 2009, works so well, in this beer works to its detriment. Perhaps I'll have to attempt another bottle, or maybe I just have an aversion to curmudgeons in general.\",\n",

Theres a lot going on here so I\\'m pretty excited about tasting this badboy. \\t\\tOh, man, this stuff is good. Dark malts, coffee, slightly burnt toast, and chocolate are the predominant flavors here and they\\'re balanced quite nicely as well. \\t\\tMouthfeel is fine. No suprises here. Its of medium to thin body with soft carbonation. Its a pleasure to have in my mouth. (Thats what she said!)\\t\\tI\\'m pleasantly suprised at how drinkable this brew is. It would go with just about any meal and is amazingly refreshing. While it has a boatload of flavors, they\\'re not overbearing.

Halfway through the glass a slight charred fruit taste starts to develop, but nothing overpowering.

While the bourbon taste is there it does not \"feel\" alcoholic. Dangerously drinkable.\\t\\tOverall this might be my favorite beer, period...at the very least it is in my top 5. What really differentiates it from similar styled beers is the sense of blending. The bourbon isn\\'t overpowering and flows beautifully with the chocolate and coffee notes, none of which I feel dominate. It is smooth without feeling heavy and slightly sweet without feeling sticky. You can not be a fan of bourbon and still enjoy this beer.... which says a lot, to me anyway.

Split w/ edelweiss, poured into a tulip.\\t\\tAppearance: Huge bubbly effervescence, fast and plentiful in a sea of hazed golden orange. A sticky, one-finger, white, foamy head has average or slightly above-average retention and leaves plenty of nice, bubbly, sticky, dry hopped-esque lacing. Nice start. \\t\\tAroma: Orange zest is prominent, slightly tart, and it melds well with the grassy dry-hop notes. Backed up by a handful of roasted biscuity notes, though this one's definitely all about the hops.\\t\\tTaste: Dry, roasted malts support a grassy, floral, fainly citrusy and therefore lightly tart hop profile. Bitterness is moderate, but between that and the hop notes, the biscuity backbone is pretty much dominated. \\t\\tMouthfeel: Big and fluffy, medium bodied but with lots of effervescence. A little over carbonated, in fact.\\t\\tDrinkability: A solid beer, though definitely one of the less impressive Founders I've had so far. This one's just a little too overcarbonated and a little too tart (I like the leafyness to come through in my dry hopped beers). That being said, it's still a very drinkable, low abv% beer, highly sessionable and recommended.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Brewed soley from smoked malt! Appears clear through a very deep mahogany-brown color. The creamy ivory head holds quite well and leaves some nice lace. The aroma is of rich Beechwood smoke. The body is full with a gentle carbonation, giving it a very creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is richly malty upfront with alot of sweet caramel and toffee (and even a touch of chocolate?), then backed by a good dose of bitterness as it heads towards the swallow. It finishes dry with a solid bitterness and a lingering smoke character. Very nice. Unlike some of the other Schlenkerla beers, the Urbock can build on the palate with its big malt, dense bitterness, and intense smoky character. Still, the smoke is so well balanced against the rich malt & hop that it never really takes center stage. This is not a quaffing beer. Rather, it should be enjoyed leisurely. Absolutely worth trying.

Room full of aromas - freshly roasted coffee beans, imported chocolates and raspberries. Great stout - coffee perfectly balanced by a residual sweetness that smooths out the rough edges and oiliness common to coffee stouts. Swirl the glass and watch the viscosity that you saw but did not believe on pouring from bottle. The flavor continuosly expresses all of the aroma notes along with dark fruit and cream with a freshly milled coffee bean that drys the finish. Truely phenomenal. Come to Papa baby!',\n",

I dont get much else smell wise. ABV hidden well.\\t\\tABV hit intertwined with the hops. Nothing much to note. There is a bitterness at the end that is displeasing to me, almost of metal. While its hoppy, the after taste doesnt sit right. I wonder if this has something to do with the ABV, as it seems unbalanced. Id like to see a BoD for this brew as the unfinishing hop character makes me think it may have sat around for a while. But with the 7%, it may just be a balance issue.\\t\\tAs noted above, Im not fond of the finish. I almost dont want to taste it. WHile Im not the biggest IPA guy, I dont think real IPA guys want to finish this way.\\t\\tId like to say this may be a bad bottle, maybe old, dunno.

I don't mind bitter beers, some of my favorites are IPAs and Double IPAs, but this was just way off for the style and it didn't offer much to make it a worthwile experience otherwise. I'd try it once more (at the brewpub next time) just because I think it's not impossible that there was something wrong with the bottle I had, although I have no reason other than the flavor to think so, but if it came out this way again it'd be my last Pike's Pale.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': '12 oz bottle courtesy of RocPorterFanatic, thanks Chad! Pours a hazed brownish-red color with a small tan head. Not much for retention and lacing.\\t\\tNose is dark fruits, toasty toffee and sweet minerals. Certainly has a British flair to it on the nose, lets see about the flavour...\\t\\tTaste is quite good, I am surprised by this one! Dark fruits and alcohol go together nicely. Brown Ale-esque maltiness throws down a nice base layer for a pretty hefty mineral aspect. Looking at the label and brewery, I was thinking this one would be a little on the gimmicky side...ok...alot on the gimmicky side; but this is quite a nice little treat that shows some nice depth and some solid UK characteristics. Mouthfeel is velvety and lowly carbonated. Chad obviously knows what hes doing sending this one around :)',\n",

This beer is an obsidian black, no light comes through, not even from a maglight at point blank range. The head is dark tan and creamy, leaving a great lace as it goes down.\\t\\tS: For all the mention of coffee, this beer doesn't have that much of a coffee smell, more just roasted malt, including maybe some black patent and unmalted barley? It smells great, but that coffee just isn't coming through. More chocolate, and I don't smell anything resembling oatmeal. It's a pretty standard smelling beer, powerful, but not too creative. About halfway down the bowl of my Sam Adams Perfect pint glass, I just got nailed with the coffee. As it warms up, I get more of it. Much more, I need to finish before it overwhelms.\\t\\tT: Hmm, I get some try roastiness but also some sweet maltiness. And here is the coffee, but still not as strong as I first expected, but more in line with what I was expecting after the smell. Its a very clean bitter, though the more I drink the more it lingers. It almost has a little sourness to it as well. As it warms, the bitter coffee becomes MUCH more evident, though I'm just not sure I'm diggin the mesh of coffee and malt. And there aren't hops, which there shouldn't be.\\t\\tM: Thin, too thin. And maybe a hair too much carbonation. But all in all ok.\\t\\tD: Not for me, but for a coffee lover, it's heaven\",\n",

Bottle came as part of a four pack and was reasonably priced, considering how hyped it is. Onto the beer.\\t\\tPoured from the bottle into a glass with a dark brown, one finger head that quickly settles into a nice lacing. Lacing coats the glass for a few seconds after each sip. The aroma is strong with notes of sweet bourbon, vanilla, expresso, and chocolate all balancing quite well. The flavor is also exceptionally balanced. Sweet bourbon notes begin each sip and slow transition into a nice smokey, roasted flavor from the malts. Vanilla, chocolate and coffee/expresso notes all become apparent as well. The oatmeal does a really good job at offering a sweetness that this beer needs. Completely balanced flavor. The mouthfeel is thick. The first couple sips leave a dry, sticky mouthfeel that subsides soon after. The drinkability is good for this heavy a stout with this high an ABV. Actually makes you want more rather than getting bored of the flavor.\\t\\tOverall, just a great stout with loads of flavor that is nicely balanced throughout the brew. A great start to the day if you so choose, but good at anytime. Just an enjoyable beer in every way. And a good value to boot.',\n",

Starts sweet McIntosh and cherry with notes of maple. It then takes a mad dash towards tartness and evolves into an impressive sourness before finishing very clean. No trace of alcohol or bitterness. Medium-thick body with a little detached carbonation.\\t\\tI find this tough to compare to much, although I definitely enjoy it more than its inspiration, Quelque Chose. I think I would prefer a bit more funkiness to it, but perhaps that is just me expecting a kriek-lambic when in fact that is not what this beer is supposed to be. Overall this is very interesting and very impressive.\\t\\t[It is tought to prove that it was this beer, but an hour or two after drinking it I started releasing the most foul gasses the world has ever smelled. This continued for hours and I assure you is quite out-of-character for me. I just thought I would mention it in case other people find the same reaction]',\n",

Smell is the only weak thing for me. Smells liko spiced cherries and malts for me, not strong enough for me. Taste is pretty awesome. Tastes of AMAZING cherries, lemon peel acidity, maple syrup huge sweetness, wood and citrus. This beer is amazing for a cherry taste, fresh, high quality cherries. Mouthfeel suits the beer pretty well. Moderate body with good carbonation, no warming and a massive coat of sweet and sour cherries and wood. Drinkability is good, I really like the taste but it will get old after a bit. The cherries and sweetness are too huge to session. I really dig Founders.\\t4.5 3.5 4.5 4.0 3.5\\t\\tEDIT 05/18/10: On at Armsby Abbey. Appearance is great with the dark pink color and frothy lace. Head isn't amazing but its a bar and aged beer. Much more oakey, in the nose (especially) and taste than I recall. Cherries are immaculately balanced between sweet and tart and blend fantastically with oak in flavor. The sweets make it a sipper but one glass is cherry heaven. MF is pretty creamy and consistency is like juice. Some warmth on the palate. Best fruit beer I have ever had.\\t4.5 4.5 4.5 4.0 4.0\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Decided to review this beer after having a 2009 next to a 2010 last night. I'll use the fresh one as the review but will leave some extra notes.\\t\\tBeer pours out black with a caramel head. Nose is soaked with bourbon and chocolate. KBS holds a dark roasted aroma. But it's not overpowering.\\t\\tThis years batch seems a little less carbonated than last years, making it richer and smoother on the palate. Oak, bourbon, chocolate, and roast malt mix together on your taste buds. Still not very over powering. Bourbon is not as hot as some people say it is. I get more chocolate than anything in this batch.\\t\\tExtra notes: I want to say that KBS, for me, has always been all over the place in flavor. Some will be heavy on bourbon and some will be heavy on chocolate and then the rest will all fall within that range. I've only actually had a few bottles that were fully balanced. But after I was able to get that rarity/hype factor out of my head I can say that I've never actually been blown away by it. And for a stout that has won so much fame, it's no where near as complex, decadent or robust as something like Bourbon County Stout. It excels in drinkability. It's smooth and silky but doesn't cause any fatigue in your tastebuds.\\t\\tThe 09 vintage, thanks to screw off caps, was awful. It had started oxidizing and tasted like wet cardboard and chalk. The nose was even worse. Underneath that, I don't feel like this is a beer to even bother aging. All the things that make this beer good are right there in the beginning and then after a year they start to fade and leave a pretty boring BA stout. \\t\\tDrink these fresh people.\",\n",

The head almost didn\\'t exist, but the ring of bubbles did leave some rings of lacing.\\t\\tS: I have used \"citrus hop aroma\" many times before. After smelling this one, those beers didn\\'t deserve it. It smells like a mix of grapefruit and orange juice. Very appealing.\\t\\tT: This one is definitely NOT balanced, but it still works. The hops definitely attack the mouth with every sip. Beautiful citrus goodness on the tongue. It tastes more like pineapple to me than grapefruit which is a good thing. Why didn\\'t I get a 4 pack of this outstanding brew?\\t\\tM: Nice in mouth carbonation and the hop bitterness join together to give it almost a spicy character. A very full body for what appears thin in the glass.\\t\\tD: Although this is loaded with hops like it should be, they do not make you pucker when you drink it. Many others in the style are a struggle to get down. This one is extremely drinkable. I just wish I had another.',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Picked up a bottle of this from Abe's in Bethlehem. I liked the dirty bastard a lot so I figured I would like this. Cost me about $3. 12 oz short brown bottle, twist off lid, poured into a snifter. \\t\\tMahogany color with off-white head. Looks pretty nice. The bubbles look somewhat similar to a guinness head forming, at least in the commercials. Good retention (considering the ABV) and lots of lacing. Looks very nice.\\t\\tThe smell reminded me how much I hate whiskey. This is aged in bourbon barrels, but I don't know the difference between bourbon and whiskey and it just smelled like whiskey to me. No malts. No hops. Just whiskey.\\t\\tThe taste is even worse. This beer is so one-sided, at least for me. I can't get over the bourbon taste. It overpowers everything. Where are the kettle-carmelized malts? What happened to the beer parts of this beer? As it sat the bourbon seemed to mellow out a bit but wasn't replaced by anything. Maybe I was just tasting the beer less with time.\\t\\tMouthfeel was too thin for the style, but the mistake seems hardly noticeable.\\t\\tDrinkability is low. This one is almost up there with triple bock, though this at least tastes like something someone (not me) would want to drink. One of the few beers I actually poured out. I was very disappointed in this one, but I probably shouldn't have been so surprised. If you like bourbon, you will probably like this but I still think the dirty bastard is a far superior brew. At least I got a cool bottle out of it (the newer style label).\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"The typical 500ML bottle came from one of my favorite breweries on the planet. This is, by far the one brewery I have left on my bucket list. \\t\\tI was SO CLOSE to Bamburg (30KM) during my trip to Germany in 2002, but I never quite made it there. In any event, I've ru'ed the day. Let's move on.\\t\\tThe pour was so so. A little quaint head, but such a great appearance, I rated it very high. The head might have been better, but the golden clear soft amber begged to be tasted.\\t\\tThe nose on this beer rocks. I know that's not very scientific, so please indulge me for a moment. Faint apple (wood) smoke flavor with undertones of sweet cherry (wood) is forward. It's not ostentatious, but subdued and superb. I'm certain the malts were smoked with this wood. If not, I'll withdraw my membership in BA.\\t\\tBeyond the nose, tasting this is exceptional. I rated a 4, but only because this is a Helles and somewhat less than the perfect Helles. Since this is my first smoked Helles, I may rescind this next week. Don't be discouraged.\\t\\tThe taste includes a nice malty flavor, contributing to the mouthfeel. Big and clean with a dry finish, I'm loving this. The balanced carbonation and somewhat subdued smoke flavor reveals a beer I'm so glad I finally found this. Although the hops were a bit subdued, hops are NOT the reason to buy this. \\t\\tSmoke smell, silky smooth taste and feel, and drinkability are awesome. Ii can't imagine how to improve this, but it's possible it may happen.\",\n",

It seems that the brewers begin with a lightly hopped but good quality pale ale, and then added the pumpkin additions, cloves, cinnamon, and other spices. The beer never feels weighted, but not under malted either. A nice fluffy head retention and soft copper hue verifies a quality base brew. Lightly estery and mildly hoppy with a slight grain bite. Finishes quite clean with a mild alcohol, pumpkin, and spicy note. Not my every day beer, but nice for the season.',\n",

A few streams of large carbonation bubbles rise to the surface. A one finger off white soapy head formed on an aggressive pour but quickly faded to a thin swirling.

There's a sugared grapefruit a orange wedge citric edge that balances out the malt bill. Smells good but a little on the weak side. \\t\\tStoudts Pale is one of those nicely balanced pale ales. Although I usually prefer the brewers going a little heavy handed on the hops I can appreciate a well balanced pale ale, and this is nicely balanced. Much more biscuity in the flavor than the aroma but the caramel still swirls around in there. The citric candy like hoppiness come around toward the backend. \\t\\tThe medium body is about right with slickness that slides through nicely. It could stand a higher level of carbonation. The lack of carbonation leaves this beer feeling a little watery when it really shouldn't.\\t\\tI could see myself drinking a few of these around the grill or while watching some football. There's a nice refreshing character that keeps this going down easy.\\t\\tWhile this is a decent pale ale I don't think I could justify picking it up again with all the great options out there.

No alcohol bite.\\t\\tMedium mouthfeel, somewhat heavy for the style, carbonation on the lighter end.\\t\\tThis IPA showcases Centennial hops very well, and because of that I find it quite similar to Two Hearted. I'd drink this one often if they sold it around here.\",\n",

The minute I smelled this guy, though, I knew I was going to enjoy it. Hoptacular. Smelled and tasted a little citric, a little sweet. Great lingering hoppy aftertaste. The head left a sticky lace around the top of my pint. I could easily have enjoyed several of these; a very drinkable IPA.

       "  'review/text': \"2009 Version: new bottle design, new glass, my Sam Adams broke earlier this fall unfortunately but replaced by the New Belgium snifter. Now that I've had a number of more massively hyped beers. I am going to keep my original rating intact because it was one of the most amazing beer experiences in my young career. Appearance suffers slightly to my jaded eyes, the head is just as dark as I remember but doesn't last as long, spread out over more surface area. Lacing not as sticky. Aroma is again incredibly good as I remember, maybe even a bit more heavy on the bourbon side that seems to mask some of the past woodiness I remember and the vanilla. Taste is phenomenal again a bit hot but still amazing, lots of bourbony heat, vanilla, oak and cocoa with the smoothest mouthfeel this side of anything. Just about lives up to the hype I remember. I would go and seek more of this stuff out because damn it's good, but I think I've had better. Abyss comes to mind, Ten Fidy holds up pretty well and one of my faves of all time GIBCS, some great shit all around.\\t\\t2009 rating A: 4 S: 4.5 T: 4.5 MF: 4.5 D: 4.5\\t\\t12oz bottle poured into one of those new Sam Adams glasses.\\t\\tA: Pours about the deepest and thickest blacks I've ever seen in a beer, the head is darker than at least 3/4 of all the beers I've ever tried, with a thick milk chocolate colored one inch creamy head that lasts surprisingly long and leaves a decent amount of lacing considering how much alcohol is in this beer.\\t\\tS: Fresh, just about the freshest ground coffee aroma I've ever come across in a beer, like walking into a tiny corner coffee shop, but along with this comes an incredibly strong dark chocolate aroma backed by a subled bourbon and vanillia that is nearly masked by the first two aromas, but is still able to be dected, for as powerful as the coffee and chocolate flavors are in this beer there is a subtle balance going on between all of these aromas the prevents this from becoming too cloyingly sweet.\\t\\tT/MF: Super thick and creamy mouthfeel but also stongly bittering as well, this bitterness seems to offset the smoothness and provides an excelent counterpoint to this inital smoothness. The taste is worth the hype I think, the first thing I notice is the woodiness of the beer, slightly smoked flavor with strong coffee and chocolate undertones which give way, as the beer warms a bit in the mouth to the more boozy aspect of this beer when vanilla and bourbon highlights begin to become more of a focal point. This beer just melts in your mouth but there is just enough carbonation to lift every flavor exactly where it needs to be. The oaky wood flavors coupled with a slightly smoky chocolate and coffee all work wonderfully together with the vanilla and bourbon. The beer says it is 10% ABV but it hides it so well that you can only really detect a subtle heat the only works to keep the beer from becoming too sweet. Everything is where it should be nothing is out of place, wonderfully crafted, worth the hype and then some.\\t\\tD: This beer is damn fine to drink, not a session or easy to drink but why would anyone want to pound this beer anyway. The super long finish almost makes you want to stop drinking and enjoy the lingering flavors but one sniff and you are right back there, begging for more, I am so glad I have more than one of these.\\t\\t2008 Rating A: 5 S: 5 T: 5 MF: 5 D: 5\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Poured from 16.9 ounce bottle into a goblet.\\t\\tA: Dark, like ground chicory. No head, no lacing.\\t\\tS: RIDICULOUS. This may be the first 5.0 I've ever given for smell. Smoked meats, barbeque, campfire, bacon. This smokebeer smells like smoke! I can smell it from across the room.\\t\\tT: Unfortunately, rather unlike the smell. Creamy smooth and not as heavy as expected. Smoky malt is strongly present, but so are other flavours...a subtle sweetness and mild hoppy bitterness round out the taste. A slight metallic tinge mars an otherwise great beer. The aftertaste is smoky and dry.\\t\\tM: Pleasant, somewhat bitter. Well-rounded and smooth.\\t\\tD: Surprisingly good for such a distinctive beer. If you ever get past the smell, the flavour is not nearly as forceful. That said, the smell of smoked meat is my favourite quality. Vegetarians beware. Otherwise, pick up a bottle at all costs. It is an experience not to be missed.\\t\\tI paired this with an aged gouda. I think it worked well.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': '50 cases made and spread throughout MO. \\t\\tFrom the label: O\\'Fallon Chocolate by the Barrel Cream Stout 22oz bottles. Stout brewed with cocoa powder and aged in bourbon barrels. \"Bourbon Barrel Stout is what we got when we aged our Cocoa Cream Stout** in bourbon barrels. It has a creamy, sweat roasted chocolate and coffee flavor enhanced by sublte bourbon flavor that adds to it complexity.\"\\t\\tPoured from 22oz bomber with a cream-colored wax-dipped head into nonic. \\t\\tA - Pours black with a darker tan-colored head. A semi-aggressive pour gives about two fingers worth of head which dies down to a thin tan-colored layer left behind as well as a small among of lacing that klings to the glass when tilted. \\t\\tS - Sweet milk chocolate hits me right off the bat. The chocolate is mixed in with some oak/wood and a subtle hint of bourbon, but not an overwhelming bourbon kick at all. This smells like a chocolate bomb...luckily, I\\'m in the mood for desert. \\t\\tT - Chocolate milk with a nice oak finish is what sticks out to me here. Very little, if any at all, bourbon notes. No hot alcoholl burn or anything going down, very smooth. A nice bitter dark chocolate finish that\\'s rich and creamy. \\t\\tM - Maybe a tad too light on body, light carbonation (perfect for this style) and not overly fizzy on the palate like some similar styles tend to be, just rich and smooth. Has a great feel to it. \\t\\tD - Super drinkable if you\\'re in the mood for this style. I wish it had some more bourbon kick to it, but that\\'s really all I have to complain about on this one. Recommended, if you can locate it.',\n",

Interesting to hold it up in front of the TV & see Harry & Sally in a maroon tint. Spare carbonation. Easy on the nose, overdose of sweet, caramel, malts, vanilla/bourbon.

Balance is exquisite. \\t\\tBarrel Aged Naked Evil might have originated in a caramel factory: it's straight-up drenched in melted sugar-coated caramel squares. Vanilla of the brown-sugar variety fades into strong bourbon shot. Sweet. Sweeet. Alcohol heat waves on the downslide, before bubblegum sugar blows everything away. Dentists should give this away to create repeat customers. Flat & heavy, no noticeable carbonation, which doesn't impact the lovely taste any, but it does rest as heavily as three Sonic burgers in the stomach.\\t\\tVery good beer but yikes, I wonder how many acres of sugar beets went into this bottle.

Really a unique smell.\\t\\tt - Chocolate and coffee. Really would be drinkable for breakfast, though I doubt I'll ever manage that one. Call me crazy, but something like hot sauce comes through at the end in addition to bitter, almost harsh dark chocolate. No hop bite. Alcohol taste is not huge but there. Chocolate is real dark. Not bad, but a little heavy on the chocolate and roasted malts to the point that it's overpowering the coffee and this is a pretty fresh example. \\t\\tm/d - Light feel but flavor covers the mouth. I feel like it should be thicker for the style. Carbonation is low, like I suspect it should be. Smooth. Drinkable for the style, complex and tasty. Of course at 8% it's a sipper and not a session beer. I'll consider putting some of these down for a year or two, I hear they do very well but I'm glad I only got one.

Again, this is not a big deal as I believe most stouts are lightly carbonated. The bourbon is present in the smell, but not overpowering. There is also some roasty goodness and a skosh of vanilla. All of the elements of the delectable smell are in the taste. It's so good, you just want to swish it around for a few minutes before saying goodbye to it. This is a great beer that is even better on tap.\",\n",

Strong retention and plenty of lacing make this a great looking beer all around.\\t\\tS: Spicy, piney hops really jump out right away, and remain the dominant aroma throughout. There's also some caramel malt and a nice dose of distinctive rye sharpness. Quite nice.\\t\\tT: The hops and rye really join forces to create a powerful wave of spicy bitterness. A little bit of malt sweetness tries to make an inroad halfway through, but the hops close it out with an intensely bitter finish. It's both intense and enjoyable, but there's a rather pronounced alcohol note on the aftertaste - far, far more than I'd expect from a beer under 7%. It's really, really tasty up to a point, but the finish just keeps bugging me.\\t\\tM: Slick medium body with moderate, sharp, late-arriving carbonation. Not bad at all, but not as smooth as I'd like.\\t\\tD: Not bad for the style, I suppose, but I really wish there were less noticeable booze. \\t\\tNotes: This is a beer with lots of great things going on, but it just doesn't come together IMO. I'd never turn one down, but I certainly don't think it fits in well with most of the other Top 100 brews. If I didn't know it was the strength of a single IPA, I'd think it was just a thin American Barleywine - it's that hot. Founders makes a bunch of world class beers, but this isn't quite one of them.\\t\\tCheers!\",\n",

I think they are phasing the Elora name out, as the same thing has been done with the Irish Ale. \\t\\tPours a clear copper-orange colour, with a short-lived, off-white head that fizzles away to nothingness disappointingly quickly. Only a thin collar around the edge of the glass remains. Decent aroma; toasted bread, caramel, and some kind of florally, fruity smell that reminds me of bergamot tea. Credit where credit is due, this brew has a nice aroma with none of the usual funky, sour notes.\\t\\tThere is a leafy, earthy dryness throughout the sip; not overpowering but a permanent presence nonetheless. Toasted, bready malts with some light caramel sweetness also show up, along with some light citrus fruitiness. Brief lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Light-bodied, with mild carbonation that fits the flavour and style nicely. A little slippery in the mouth; very smooth and easy to drink.\\t\\tThis is not a stellar brew, but it's tasty enough and it's a reasonably good bitter from a brewery that seems to be improving somewhat. I like Wellington's bitter a bit more, but this is an equally quaffable brew I could see myself getting again, and something I'd happily try on tap if I saw it being offered.\",\n",

The bottle was way too cold so I waited 15 minutes before I even began reviewing this one\\t\\tA- The color is a magnificent hazy copper with tiny flakes of sediment floating all about. There is no head at all. It almost looks flat!\\tS- Wow! An overpowering sweat bourbon smell. The bourbon almost burns the nose. However, there is just enough toffee and maple aroma to remind me that it is not hard alcohol. One last smell before I dive in and I almost get a fire roasted marsh mellow scent.\\tT- The hot burn of a bourbon but the sweat taste of toffee. This is a very unique beer. I am not sure how I feel just yet. The first few tastes were very HOT and had the initial alcohol burn. After a few more sips the heat fades away and the buttery toffee flavors kicks in. The more I drink, the more I like this beer. This beer is very complex and the flavor seems to change just a little with each sip.\\tM- Other than the initial burn, this is a very creamy beer. Actually, Nemesis is not nearly as syrupy as I expected. \\tD- This beer is very drinkable considering the high ABV. I had no problem finishing my 12oz bottle, but think I would prefer to split this with others next time. And yes there will be a next time. I have just put away a bottle in the cellar and think after another year it will be even better. Although it is very drinkable for the high ABV I don't see how I can rate this beer high in the drinkability category. \\t\\tOverall, another great beer from a great brewery. I am now going to have to put Founders up there with FFF, Shorts, Bells, and Surly as my favorites.\",\n",

Not much maple, very very faint. Some vanilla notes as well.\\t\\tT: Bitter coffee and chocolate up front. Some bourboney goodness and a hint of maple in the finish. As it warms there is more of a maple and vanilla presence. Very decadent and sweet. \\t\\tM: The mouthfeel is THICK and creamy. It coats the mouth and is almost chewy. The sweetness ads somewhat of a cloying quality to the mouthfeel. A bit hot as there is defiantly some alcohol burn on the back of my throat in the finish, not bad but noticeable. \\t\\tO: This was a very good beer. However, I feel regular KBS may be a bit more enjoyable for me. I think it might have benefited from a year in the cellar as the heat was a tad more than I like, and I do enjoy a hot beer.

       "  'review/text': \"I actually picked up this bottle in a trade a long time ago, though now it is commercially available here, it definitely was not then. I have held unto it for over a year, and I am just getting around to trying it now. It's a 2007 bottling, and has been cellared around 50 degrees. I poured it vigorously into an oversized wine glass.\\t\\tAppearance - The pour was very nice producing a thick dark brown liquid, essentially black with no light penetration what so ever. Rich deep, and thick chocolate colored lace then formed on the top of it to a height of around two inches before finally settling down onto a pillow if tan around one finger in height that stayed throughout the session. Very nice web like side glass presentation on here as well. Overall, definitely a very good looking stout by all means.\\t\\tSmell - The aroma was just as rich and sweet, the first notes to hit me were a nice sweet milk chocolate, lactose, and a nice burnt caramel aroma. Very sweet, with hints of coffee throughout. A nice mixture of roasted malts, and not overly heavy. No, hint of the alcohol in it at all which was very nice.\\t\\tTaste - Very good profile here. It was a little bit lighter then some of the other big stouts I have had, but still could put a hurting on most any other. Rich milk chocolate, molasses and vanilla hints were the first right out of the gate. Very sweet with lots of lactose sugar like flavors coming in, probably from the oatmeal. A slight warming on the back of the throat, but other then that there was literally no hint of the alcohol what so ever. Really a fine quality stout here. Nice dry touches in the finish capped it off well and left a long lingering sweet coffee like taste in the mouth. Very well done indeed.\\t\\tMouthfeel - It was a nice full-bodied stout, though nowhere near as filling as some of the others can be. Rich carbonation and a smooth creamy profile were nothing to sneeze at. Definitely not the thick sludge like RIS's, this was just right and a really nice feeling.\\t\\tDrinkability - Outstanding for a big stout over 9% ABV. There was hardly a touch of alcohol anywhere near this thing. Quite impressive with really just sweet roasted malts playing the major roles here. Very nice underlying hints of chocolate just were the icing on the cake.\\t\\tOverall, I thought this was excellent. I cannot wait to go down to Barleys and try one of these on tap. It really was a great Imperial Stout and for those love the sweeter versions, this would be right up your alley. Definitely have to recommend this one.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': '12oz bottle into tulip. Bottled on 03.13.11\\t\\tA: Body pours a slight orange, ruby red hue. The head has low formation and retreats very quickly to a thin layer around the rim of the glass. Very little appearance of any carbonation. Lacing is also not left behind. \\t\\tS: Aroma is low and very light on the cherry aspect. The note of sweet malt is in the front of things.\\t\\tT/M: The first sip shows a good base ale that has a bit of a low hop profile and a nice malt base. The cherry is very subtle. Flavor in the finish shows the tartness of the cherry, but overall sweetness is low. Mouthfeel is a silky texture, that is very nice. \\t\\tO: Overall this is a very smooth and drinkable ale. Not to the extent of some other world class cherry brews, but still a nice sipper for a hot day. The lack of robust cherry flavor is the main downfall for this beer.',\n",

The look is yellow/orange with tiny sediments (I guess from the wet hops?)floating all through out. I enjoyed stairing at my glass watching the little floaties. Great fresh hop taste, with little malt in the background. The malt base is honeyish but not really sweet at all but slightly toasty. It's just there to prevent the hops from being too much. The hop flavor is strong from the beginning and lasts throughout the finish. There is some bitterness but moreso hoppiness with flavors of grapefruit, orange rinds, and piney notes. Goes down very easily, the body is on the lighter side, but to me is the ultimate session beer. I really wish this was available in the summer. Would be ultimate summer beer. Hop harvest time needs to change. ha.\\t\\tI liked it so much I went and grabbed a case of it for myself.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Man let me say this first off.\\t\\tI am REALLY picky when it comes to coffee stouts. As a huge coffee nerd, when the coffee profile is off, i notice, and i am harsh on it. Java Stout is one example, Surly Coffee Bender is a bit lesser example.\\t\\tAnd then as soon as i rethink the entire style(withholding the mighty Peche Mortel), Founders comes out and makes a fantastic brew like FBS, and i no longer need to lose faith in the style.\\t\\tWith a beautiful balance off surprisingly well done roasty coffee flavors, strong Coco, earthyness, and vanilla, this one doesn't have that offensive stale coffee taste so common to the Coffee Stout style. The finish lets some of the coffee flavors linger a bit longer, and stand out just a bit more from the coco it shared the stage with at the start, but never reaches that cloyingly annoying level.\\t\\tThis one has quality flavors balanced with an excellent mouthfeel.\\t\\tYea, an excellent mouthfeel, i think this is one of the real keys of this beer, and partially how it tromps the others of same style. The Oatmeal gives this one a fantastic creamy and smooth palatte coating mouthfeel, that is essential for the style and unfortunately often goes overlooked. Thankfully Founders knows what they are doing, they are ever impressive and sometimes make others look like amateurs.\\t\\tWith as balanced and rewarding as this beer is it would be so easy to reach for another. The lingering brown lacing of the glass once full just begs for another, and the still present coffee notes kissing the palette whisper out to continue.\\t\\tAside from Dieu Du Ciel, Founders has been the only brewery able to make a Coffee Stout i've been able to highly recommend. Bravo.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"This beer exhibits a deeper copper color when cask conditioned. It pours with a very large, fluffy tan head that sticks around a long while. This creates a very nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is less hops and more malt sweetness, and actually is not as nice as the bottled version. The flavor is much more of both the malt and the hops, while retaining a great balance. The mouthfeel is a bit smoother, and felt just a bit more robust than the bottled version. The drinkability is excellent, and I had a couple of these delicious IPA's. Tasting this side by side with the bottled version was a nice opportunity to note the subtle differences that cask conditioning makes. All in all, a solid beer from Stoudt's.\",\n",

Cheers fellas!\\t\\tNotes from 10-31-11 after a long night of trickin \\t*Pour into a 10oz PizzaPort fest sampler nonic.\\t\\tA: Founders Breakfast Stout pours a super dark cola colored ale with some lighter edges to it. Its not that viscous in appearance at all or not as viscous as I was expecting I guess. A thin rim of brown sugar foam formed and faded rather quickly. Only some spots of lace.\\t\\tS: Smells of roasted grains with some earthy oak like aromas. Ground coffee and cocoa powder. Sweet with a chocolate syrup likeness.\\t\\tT: Tastes of sweet toasted cereals with an almost smoky dry roasted coffee bean flav. Has an earthy hop spice and rich roasted bitter chocolates give a bit of tart. Not a ton of chocolate or coffee. Both are subtle and really well balanced overall. Not overly sweet in any way. Some alcohol flavors but not hot. Rather smooth and quite tasty actually.\\t\\tM: Thinner than expected mouthfeel that manages to still be somewhat viscous across the palate. Makes for better sessionability IMO. Creamy. Medium body. Good carbonation gives a nice dry crisp finish.\\t\\tD: Overall a very nice and approachable Stout with some subtle chocolate and coffee character. \\tNothing too intense really but quite well balanced and delicious. Would definitely like to receive again.',\n",

Really strange, I've never seen a beer lose it's head so quickly, kinda reminds me of a glass of Pepsi.\\tS - Bourbon dominates the nose, along with chocolate syrup and coffee. As a bourbon fan, this smells pretty good, if a bit one-dimensional.\\tT - Dark malt, coffee, vanilla, chocolate syrup and bourbon. Flavors are nicely on-point but...\\tM - ...Horrible mouthfeel. Thin body with a weird, fizzy carbonation. Once again my soda comparison comes in. Feels like chocolate-bourbon Pepsi.\\tD - I'm struggling to get through this, I can't believe how badly they screwed up the mouthfeel on this. Make it creamy with lower carbonation an you'd have a great beer on your hands. As it is? A trainwreck.\",\n",

Was pitch black in color even when against a light. Had about a finger of dark brown foam that slowly settled into a collar. Good lacing. The aroma was heavy on the coffee but could also detect lots of chocolate and some sour cherry. The taste was really good and I hate coffee so that says alot about how good this one is. Has a nice solid taste from start to finish. Just the right amount of bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel was creamy and solid. Because of my general dislike of coffee, I had to mark down the drinkability since while it's excellent it's not one that I'd reach right away for a second one. Overall, I highly recommend and can see what it is so highly rated. (4, RB-OAY, T, Y)\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Poured from the bottle into my large Dogfish head snifter, fresh as can be, patiently reserved in line for a simple four pack to be consumed and reviewed. This is my milestone, and my 300th review on Beer Advocate. Much thanks to the brothers. Onward...\\t\\tOff the visible pour it is borderline motor oil black out of the bottle but not quite... Head is very solid and cocoa light brown I would say with a good solid retention. After falling for LOTS of time (having consumed two of these in one sitting) it maintains a collar that will not go away. The body is my personal favorite walnut brown, but just wants to hint... I mean just hint at black midnight. Based on all that... she looks great. Decent lacing giving up to leopardy like spotting. \\t\\tBouquet is jarring for this style and a big surprise considering the abv in front. DRY husky grain, faint dried out wood, not a wood smell that I could pinpoint (regardless that they come from American oak bourbon barrels). The sense is something tannic is coming even though you DO NOT smell tannins. It strangely (dare I say it) feels like fresh cut timber or assembled oak furniture. Very dense and full of body. Some simple cheap store bought coffee also. Extremely unique smelling and balance.. really nice. When I smell these aromas, they feel like I am tasting and drinking this beverage as it is. Cellar like smell with a dampness that isn't ruined, musty, no not BAD.. just down there.... DANK DANK DANK!!!! Chocolate milk bent on the nose. No sense of heat or big booze coming for this large ABV.\\t\\tTaste is well, stealing something from the vocabulary.. exceptional when factoring the mouthfeel. Almost silky but SOoooo... easy palatable and borderline wet in feel. Big milk chocolate front but not turning into a sweet chocolate bomb. Sweetness hints, faint standard coffee, but extremely balanced profile. Slight tannins in the mouth pushing forward and puckering, it is dry I will give it that but tolerable. What is not here for me on taste just for the record is tobacco and fruit. Vanilla for me personally .... creeps up unknowingly then takes over. It's not apparent at first but then makes it's presence known latter while drinking. This is not a beer that feels particularly like whiskey either. It's not bourbon feeling at all (I have a bias being a bourbon drinker) but that is a good thing this is truly a great beer, and the highly masked abv boozy quality that you would think came from this is completely hidden. This should be considered beer forward and not whiskey. The chocolate and vanilla mix gets into almost ice cream territory, with much fun. This could pass easily as a dessert beer for sure but works also on its own.. So stupidly easy drinking, creamy, almost dark chocolate, balanced soft tannins, woody, FROTHY, too much to desire.\\t\\tOverall some serious intense craft and quality while drinking this. This is magic right here, and some great feel. Just for the record the high abv on this is dangerous cause I feel like I could just pound these back like no tomorrow. Part of that stupid drinkability, besides all this sophistication and time put into it, is that it feels like a kids morning chocolate breakfast drink, such as Carnation Instant Breakfast drink. Does this beer taste like bourbon... NO. Emphatically no giving way to a good magic that is masking the alcohol.. It is just a great tasting beer and very unique and done superbly.\",\n",

It wasn\\'t bad, but it wasn\\'t incredible either. The aftertaste is what turned me off. It really left a taste of smoke in my mouth that I couldn\\'t help but associate with a tailgate.

       "  'review/text': \"Picked this up down at Buy-Rite in Jersey City since that was the only place around here where I could find it. I hadn't had a Stout's beer in ages and even though this was listed as a Dopplebock, I would agree with most reviewers on here that this was more characteristic of an English Ale or an earthy IPA. That's not to say that this was bad, but there's no doubt that I've ever had a Dopplebock quite like this one before.\\t\\tNice appearance to the pour - with a radiant amber hue, solid lacing, and a head that almost wouldn't quit. Lemon and pine are strong in the aroma and assert themselves in the taste, with a good amount of caramel and crystalline sweetness to back them up. Like a Black IPA, this pushed the envelope of what a Dopplebock can be and even the appearance was different, since there was just a bit of swirling activity apparent when I held this up to the light. The astringent taste that hit me up front faded to a warming and more full-bodied sensation in the back and this beer made that transition quite nicely. It probably had to do with the slightly oily mouthfeel of it and carbonation being spot-on, since it help clean up the range of flavors after each sip was long gone. \\t\\tTo be fair, this is a bit strong in the alcohol department. Amazingly, I couldn't taste it at all and it was only after I downed the whole bottle that the booze snuck up on me. There's a good tang to this like in a slightly spicy wing sauce and just like that, the flavor of this kept me coming back for me. As cheesy as the name of this beer may be, this certainly lived up to its name and hopheads should certainly seek this out!\",\n",

This beer looks damn good.\\t\\tS: A clean and grainy smell, the pale malt and subtle hopping is very enticing. Even though the style is known to have a much more subdued bouquet, this one is still quite assertive.\\t\\tT: Starts off with a smooth pale malt introduction, semisweet and a good base for the hops that enter the picture. Very well-hopped, as it straddles the line between too much and not enough... perfectly in the middle for a great bittering flavor. At first, I didn't actually notice the smokiness, as its quite subtle, but I definitely picked up on it in the aftertaste after a few sips. \\t\\tM: Carbonation is great, and the beer has a wee bit of a heavier body to it than expected, but keeping in mind this is in reference to the helles lager style. I actually enjoy that fact, and furthermore, the hops provide a bit of slickness with a slightly creamy aspect from the carbonation. Great in this category as well.\\t\\tD: Overall, an insanely drinkable beer. With only 4.3% abv, a light (but not ultra-light) body, and enough hops to keep the palate interested, this would make a great session beer. Fans of German lagers, especially the Helles style, will definitely appreciate this one. Very well done.\",\n",

Now a very nice size brown head rises...very frothy, and has excellent retention! Even leaves VERY sticky patchy lacing all around the glass. An ideal looking stout!\\t\\tAroma at first is malty, roasty, and ironically...a tad hoppy. Then I let it sit for a few minutes. Now its awesome! Loads of sweet maple syrup and chocolate.\\t\\tFlavor...WOW. Out of this world. This beer did not disappoint! Great thick chewy mouthfeel, chocolate, toasted malts, and thick sweet maple syrup! I'm not sure if this is so chunky due to it being bottled...but it's a little unusual. Regardless, it doesn't scare me away. Thick, low carbonation, chewy, malty, sweet, lightly boozy mouthfeel. Delicious! This needs to get bottled more often!\",\n",

There is a huge outgasing of carbonation through the brew; clarity is moderate. The head falls slowly, but is really chunky even after sitting for a bit. The aroma is full of raisin, a light alcohol spiceyness, as well as a healthy Belgian spiceyness and a little fruity ester from the yeast. I think this one smells nice. Taking a sip, I get a bit of almost smokey phenol that moves to a mild raisin and alcohol, finishing strong in spiceyness, almost a little pepperyness. The flavor actually feels a little muted. It is not as bold as I was expecting. Mouthfeel is thick with a solid moderate carbonation. It is almost a little chewy. I find this one very drinkable. It shows the ABV, but it is never a flaw in the brew. I really think the flavor and aroma marry well. The fruity ester seems a little misplaced, otherwise it is nice.',\n",

Big ups to pimpp for the chance to try this brew. \\t\\tPours a thick, viscous, sticky black liquid into a Duvel tulip, forming a good finger of khaki colored head and descending into a thin layer on top. Spotty lacing is left behind. Smells of rich roasted coffee, vanilla beans, dry oatmeal flakes, fresh cocoa beans. I get this in a lot of coffee stouts, but again I get notes similar to soy sauce. This is not a turn off in any way, just eludes to the potency of the malt character (4.5, smell). Taste is quite amazing, with the coffee character initially dominating but then falling back and letting the sweetness of the chocolate and vanilla flavors come forward. There is a nice bitterness in the finish that is reminiscent of the bitterness you would expect from a rich dark chocolate. Coffee character stays in the nose after a good mouth-full. The alcohol is completely masked in taste. I can only recognize the alcohol in a little heat that I get in my cheeks in the mouthfeel. The flavors really come together to give a strong contrasting, yet beautifully balanced profile. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and can't wait until the next time I get the chance to try it once again. Thank you Founders.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"Nice dank, black solid coloring but the head was quite weak and the beer itself looking a bit thin. Smell is mostly a candied sugar with hints of vanilla and the bourbon toned down quite a bit. I actually like it. Not overpowering. Some dark chocolate and not much coffee. Taste is roasty and slightly bitter. Can't taste the bourbon at all. Actually may need to let it set a bit. It is a tad too cold. But so far I think it is better than most people give it. Ok letting it sit hasn't opened much more flavor. The lack of an aftertaste bugs me the most. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Very middle of the road stout. Not bad but not great.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': \"I love hoppy beer so I was pumped to give this one a try. Its a deep, orange amber in color. Thin, off-white head forms from a gental pour and sticks around forever. Smooth lacing coats the glass. Excellent head retention for such a big brew.\\t\\tTons of spices in the nose. Cinammon and nutmeg come to mind. Delivers an overload of piney hops and a moderate alcohol burn to the nostrils. Smooth maple sweetness also. As it warms it gives off a butterrum kind of aroma.\\t\\tHops unload and never let up with an intense grapefruit and pine bitterness that dominates from beginning to end. A dense, maple malt sweetness creeps in mid-drink to balance but, in all its strength, is still overpowered by the hops. Spices are there too, cinammon and nutmeg. Its like a hopped up eggnog beverage or a syrupy apple cider. Let it warm up a bit and it has a more mellow and smooth character but is still not enough to tame the massive hop army. Aftertaste is bitter, bitter, bitter!\\t\\tDense, syrupy body. Sticky on the lips. Low to moderate carbonation. Very drying on the palate. Alcohol warmth hits your throat a second or two after each sip and seems to intensify as you drink.\\t\\tThe complexity of flavors are so interesting that you can't help but want to take another sip. However, the intense hops and dense body make it difficult to drink more than one bottle. All I've got to say is savor it with the utmost care and respect as it could very easily kick your ass. Definitely a must try for adventurous hop lovers. I would love to try it one tap.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Let\\'s see...a Monty Python beer from Black Sheep brewery. Bonus points already. Inspecting the bottle, I find some authentic Monty Python artwork, and a brew that claims to be \"tempered over burning witches\". That\\'s by far my favorite beer adjuct. Far superior to blackberry, raspberry, and all the other berry ales my girlfriend likes. (I like them too.)\\tThe holy grail\\'s pour is something spectacular for me, particularly from a bottled beer. The head was so dense Gary Coleman could breakdance on it. I had to take a quick sip so the head would start to die down, and I could pour the rest. Incredible lacing, leaving thick clumps of head sticking to the glass.\\tColor was pretty nice. It reminded me of Bass, or any other classic english pale. The aroma was great. Mellow and subtle. A balanced aroma, with floral and a light estery undertone.\\tI have to say that this review is gonna be biased. I love this style. Holy Grail tasted great, with mild hops, medium body, light floral aftertaste, and all the trappings of any english pale worthy of Britain. One thing of note about this beer, odd for the style, is that it held a big head throughout, and formed little islands of foam on the side of the glass. Not flat little circles, but half inch thick mounds that oddly resembled the white rabbit from the movie.\\tThe ale was a little pricey, but it\\'ll be in my fridge again. I liked it a lot. Like Arnie said...\"Oll be bock!\"',\n",

       "  'review/text': '2011 update, bottled June 2nd, enjoyed July 19th. Aroma and flavor are very heavy in marijuana and onions. Wow. Like REALLY heavy in those to flavors. Quite different than my notes of the 2010 vintage. I can see how this can be a polarizing beer. Good bitterness but not off the charts. Strong malt backbone. Will probably cellar one. Do have a 2010 I will crack open soon for comparison.\\t\\tOriginal review, August 5, 2010:\\t12oz bottled on May 28, 2010. Pours lightly hazy orange/amber/copper with a one finger light tan head, leaves some spots of lacing and holds a light foamy cap. Aroma is heavy earthy, grassy and floral hops, some citrus and pine, light tropical fruits underneath, some caramel and bread. Only moderate strength, however. Does get better as it warms. Huge flavor of resinous and citrus rind hops, some pine, very bitter, a strong caramel malt presence is here, but it is short lived as the finish is an even bigger wave of biting bitterness and a kick of alcohol that only adds to the effect. Excellent. Mouthfeel is full, oily with sharp carbonation. I love em bitter and this is one of the best Ive had yet.\\t\\tAppearance 4, Smell 4, Taste 4.5, Mouthfeel 3.5, Overall 4.5, Score 4.28',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'April 2007 Bottle Date; Sampled April 2008\\tA careful pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces an initially three-finger thick, lightly browned, tan colored head. The beer is a deep, plum color and shows a brilliantly clear, cranberry hue when held up to the light. It is incredibly well carbonated, the body being a seething mass of bubbles. The aroma is quite fruit with lots of berry notes. A deeper inspection of the nose yields a deep spiciness that really accents the sweet fruit notes; seems to be a mix of orange peel and coriander, both of which dominate the aroma.\\t\\tQuite dry tasting, with a brown malt driven finish of toasted grain and lightly-roasted coffee beans. The spices contribute a lot to the profile of each sip, but more in an aromatic way through the throat and up to the nasal passages. Earthy, slightly herbal coriander notes and a kiss of orange zest compete with the brown malt character. Quite light feeling on the palate, the zippy carbonation certainly helps with this. The finish takes on a peppery note that mixes with a touch of young-ginger character and even a cardamom like note. A dry, raisin fruit flavor is noticeable just before the coriander flavors drown it out. This is fairly light, and in line with what I like to find in Belgian-styled beers of this strength; it does have a slight heft to it though, but not enough to keep this from being fairly drinkable.\\t\\tThis can be a little bit vegetal at times & the aroma is a bit one dimensional in its spice notes, but it is a fairly tasty brew. While light enough to be drinkable, the spice notes seem to get in the way. I like the toasted, browned, whole-grain bread crust flavor that is here.\\t\\tPurchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ',\n",

I assume it is a Belgian yeast giving off a sweet smell, maybe candi sugarish?. Taste seems more toward the double IPA taste versus a Belgian style double IPA. Alcohol taste is present but not as much as expected based on ABV. Nicely puckering with a bit of sweetness in the background for balance. My only complaint is that there seems to be some sort of medicinal (Robitussin? Aspirin?) taste that appears to negatively affect the overall taste of the beer that I can't seem to place to save my life. I put my tastebuds through a check and balance and they seem to be in line...I can't place this faint medicinal taste. Otherwise the beer is a very solid offering.\",\n",

Touch of pine and honey in the nose.\\t\\tBold hops dominate the flavor to start it off. Very citrusy with lemon, orange and grapefruit notes. Malt is sweet and honey-like. The alcohol warms the throat and the hops dry the tongue letting you know you're drinking a real beer. Finish is surprisingly clean and the drying effect is short-lived.\\t\\tMedium to full-bodied, a bit lighter than I expected and this adds to the drinkability. Low amount of fizz but enough to tickle the senses. Texture is creamy at the end.\\t\\tFirst DIPA I've tried and I am definitely impressed. A very well rounded beer. Flavors are robust yet balanced. Feel is dry then clean and crisp at the end. Alcohol is barely detectable in the taste, making it somewhat deceptive and even dangerous. My gut tells me this has been aged because the hops seem a bit restrained and the finish just a tad too smooth. Maybe I'm wrong and the beer is just that good. Another exceptional brew from Founders.\",\n",

It smells of smoked ham, wood chips, and oak. It's full on ham and is close to Krebs Smoked Porter and the Alaskan Smoked Porter in terms of the nose. The flavor is a little subdued compared to the aromas. It has good flavor and is very heavy on the ham, but subdued compared to other smoked beers that I've had. I do enjoy this one however. It's the lightest smoked beer that I can say that I really like. This is like hog light in a bottle. It drinks between light and medium in body and leaves behind a very ham like aftertaste and is very moist. It's a likable beer and worth a try for sure.\",\n",

Very nice flavor, the different pieces come together very well, with chocolate on top, a nice coffee kick, followed by the oatmeal sweetness; I personally find it hard to think the flavors can completely mesh, but this did a good job of it.

Right after there is some milk chocolate, with a touch of sweetness. Towards the middle the oatmeal comes out, with a bit of coffee appearing again.

       "  'review/text': 'As I poured this american-influenced porter, I noticed that it was much thinner than I anticipated. Its pitch-black color conjured up images of the darkest of nights. With all that I had heard about this porter, I was expecting a much fuller head, but the head was very thin and quickly receded leaving red-hued lacings along the glass.\\tThe aroma is full of roasted malts. These roasted malts waft the smell of inviting coffee and/or espresso grinds. After allowing the beer to warm, caramel and dark chocolate notes began to enter into the aroma. Surprisingly, the hop presence in the aroma is almost non-existent.\\tThe taste is very distinctive and can be broken down into two separate parts. The first part is full of delicious burnt or roasted coffee. The second part of the taste (back-end) is a coating of hops that are pleasant and well balanced with the tastefulness of the coffee.\\tThe carbonation in this porter was very nice leading to light creaminess. The body was thin, but as the beer warmed, the carbonation weakened allowing the body to become fuller. At 6.5% ABV and composed with 45 IBUs, Founders Porter is an excellent interpretation of a hoppy porter.',\n",

Aside from a couple of local wheat beers, this was the only non-BMC product carried.\\t\\tI was served a golden tan colored, lightly carbonated beverage in a typical beer glass. It was served very cold, as I assumed it would be. Very little head, which I attribute more to the bartender than to the beer.\\t\\tThe aroma was a citrusy, floral mixture of lemon and grapefruit.\\t\\tThe taste was much like the smell. A hoppy, lemony, grapefruity extravaganza with some medicinal notes thrown in. Aftertaste of biscuit or bread crust made this a pleasant experience after the bitterness subsided.\\t\\tAll things considered I would say that this is a pretty drinkable IPA, which may be a problem for hop heads but is better for those that are just trying to get their feet wet in the world of heavy hopped beers. I think it was better at my wedding when I had this from the bottle, but considereing the selection at the Train Wreck, I was happy to see a familiar buddy on tap. Would have been better with some spicy food, but there wasn't much to be had at this particular establishment. Also, I tried drinking a wheat beer after this and couldn't really taste it since my tastebuds had been numbed by the power of the hops. Respect the hops.\",\n",

The body just looks righteous and fit for the name, as noted by the mild bourbon colors resting at the edges when I sip. By far one of the better looking stouts. As far as presentation is concerned all the right elements are here\\t\\tS: the nose is monstrous. Rich coffee, hearty malts, chocolate, and globs of molasses with some vanilla infused bourbon. The smells listed may seem ordinary for some stouts and whiskey based brews of this sort but the '09 KBS is fairly extraordinary in the nose. Even so, things are starting to smell a little moon-shiny as my journey continues\\t\\tT: luscious cocoa, heavily roasted and darkened malts, pulverized hazelnut coffee beans, some cured vanilla beans, and a thin slice of fudge cake. I might be a little overzealous about this brew but it really is just that darn good! No if's and or buts! It is a great melding of bitter and sweet while being both smooth and rough. Eventually, after numerous small sips, I find that the bitterness plays between coffee and a burnt sucrose character. Even more amazing is the lack of alcohol on the palate. It drinks so flipping smooth with really no ABV intensity at all. The way this beer moves is top notch\\t\\tM: the mouthfeel is quite sumptuous and close to velvet on the tongue. It also holds a relatively mild feeling while being so smooth. Just great, absolutely great!\\t\\tD: 5 stars. I might venture to say that the bourbon is rather subdued (the extra year of age no doubt) but this is not a problem for me. All the right ingredients in this one.

       "  'review/text': 'Originally reviewed on October 14, 2006. 12 Oz Bottle. Aroma blasts forth a heavy phenolic crush of banana skins and ripe fruits. Surprising for the style. This is carried along with a quite hot alcohol. Flavor is more of the phenolic yeast character, but moreso in a sweet, bright crisp fruity schnapps character, yet a little shallow. The flavor runs a current of milder malts and not a depth of sugars. There are some noticable aged belgian style hop characters. Alcohol is very warm and biting and the beer could use a little more depth for the style. Really not terrible though.',\n",

The nose is an all malt base; complex and slightly sweet with a slightly peat-like smokiness, almost like a very mild Rauchbier. The flavor follows suit nicely with the smokiness holding off initially, allowing the slightly malty sweet backbone to shine through and follows up with a pleasently smokey finish that isn't overly aggressive. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick with a smooth carbonation. Overall a very enjoyable beer, not overdone and nicely balanced. Very easy drinking beer.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine Issue #46 (Nov 2010): \\t\\tQuite the showing of head retention on a muddled amber brew. Spicy rye and malt sweetness, with some herbal citric aromas from the hemp and hops. Creamy smoothness runs lush in the medium body. The hops play well with their cousin, hemp, with bitter to citric to herbal flavors. Strong enough malt base with a slightly sharp, spicy edge from the rye, which balances and compliments the hemp and hops. Some sweet tobacco--or should we say, tea-like hemp flavor--lingering in the semidry finish. A very drinkable and extreme session ale.',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Had at the grand opening. Imperial Black IPA. Beer #1 in their NoDable Series. Served from tap into a NoDa snifter. Poured pitch black with a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, citrus, citrus hop, earthy, and earthy hop. The flavor was of roasted malt, citrus, citrus hop, earthy, earthy hop, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The roastiness on this one was quite intense. The citrus notes I found in this one added a nice touch of complexity. The earthiness also plays a nice a role in this one. Really glad I got the chance to try this at their grand opening.

       "  'review/text': 'Left Coast Pale Ale pours dark copper with some haze, and a thin, sticky head. The aroma is subdued and hoppy. There is a hint of bready malt but the nose is mostly lemony and citrusy. Its flavour is again hoppy and bitter, but without much depth, and the supporting malt profile is hard to appreciate. The finish is dry. Unfortunately the beer is quite thin bodied and the soft carbonation gives the mouthfeel a watery texture. Drinkability is good, and this beer is worth trying.',\n",

This is a beautiful shade of deep red that has a lot of different hues showing through. The head is a pink and fluffy cap that eventually goes away leaving a ring of bubbles around the collar. A net of fine lace slides down the glass.\\t\\tS - Smells like a bowl of fresh raspberries with sugar piled on top. Reminds me a bit of Lindemans framboise, but without the acidity. I can detect a small amount of hops pulling through, which I really appreciate in a category that can be all about the fruit and not the beer. \\t\\tT - Sour apple and tart raspberry are the first flavors to touch the tongue, along with a vague funky sour note. Again, hops show through and make this more of a beer lover's fruit beer than a girly candy treat. This has a neat funky earthy almost moldy mushroomy aspect that makes it a bit of balance, but does add some complexity.\\t\\tM - Light bodied with some moderate carbonation. A bit slick and sugary.\\t\\tD - A pretty good fruit beer that has a lot of complex and unique flavors. It's no lambic, but it's a decently drinkable fruit beer.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This pours a very light straw yellow, (almost the color of a light macro) with a white head. Smells like a fragrant rose, almost like a summer perfume. After asking the waitress we found out it has lime leaves, lemon grass, and coriander. The taste is very close to what a perfume smells like. It is interesting and has you wanting another sip. This is very light and a good summer offering. The mouthfeel was good, but the flavors were very overpowering, leaving this beer a little imbalanced. This beer is good for a hot sumer day, and is very different which was a nice change of pace. I would recommend it to expand your taste in beer, and see what differences their can be in a beer. Cheers to founders for taking a chance.',\n",

I generally crack one of these open once a month or so as a treat for being particularly awesome. \\t\\tIt's basically like my pint of Ben and Jerry's. Rich, creamy and delicious, it is one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. \\t\\tFirst, it looks like beer strained through coffee grounds, head and liquid. Second, it smells like unicorn poop, with just enough of a booze nose to remind you that you are drinking real. Thirdly, it tastes like god's melted ice cream cone, coats the tongue and goes down smoothly. Vanilla, caramel and coffee hit you up front and the bourbon finishes you off. Each sip is superior to the last as this bad boy warms up to room temperature. The only reason I can't drink a six-pack of these is because it is so decadent that my heart may stop. Find some. Drink some. Love some.\\t\\tIf I had to pick one beer to drink for the rest of my life, it might just be KBS.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'This lager needs no Photoshop, it should require no help doing its own commercials and billboards; a clear golden body absorbs the light like a sponge and spits it out far and wide in the form of bright, refulgent rays. Its head is pristine white and even manages to inscribe the glass. \\t\\tAmstel is wise to stay away from the green glass bottles; it\\'s no coincidence that this smells cleaner than most Dutch export lagers. The aroma is faint but heavy on the bready notes, like stepping into a bakery, with corn grits playing only a negligible role. It doesn\\'t smell very appetizing but at least it\\'s easily recognizable as beer - and not corn syrup or skunk. \\t\\tThe taste is almost non-existent which would likely make it agreeable to mainstream drinkers. I admit I find it somewhat refreshing. It is, by most accounts, a thoroughly average beer in the sense that its flavour is grainy-sweet and ordinary, free of bitterness, and the presence of adjunct flavour light, far from off-putting, but still a little perceptible.\\t\\tFrankly, Amstel does nothing for me. I\\'ve had plenty of swill lagers like it, both better and worse, and a bland, mainstream beer like this doesn\\'t offer me anything new. It has no character to distinguish it; there\\'s nothing that set\\'s it apart from its competitors (except that it lacks the foul adjunct tinge of some). Still, I won\\'t go so far as to say it\\'s a \"bad\" beer...\\t\\tOf all the beers I had in Holland, the pint of Amstel I had after a hot summer day of walking through Amsterdam for the first time is still one of the most memorable - and not memorable for the wrong reasons. It was cold, clean, ordinary and refreshing - what more could I ask of it? It would be far from the best beer I had that trip, but it did the trick when called upon.',\n",

Flavors are well balanced and suited to an American Pale Ale style with more hop flavor than indicated by the 35 IBU on the label.\\t\\tM- Medium carbonation and feel making it almost bodering on a summer ale, refreshing.\\t\\tO- This is a solid true to the style beer. Falls right in the middle for a great American Style Pale. This is one I could sit down and have more than one for sure and overall its a winner for this brewery',\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for this one. It pours a clear deep amber color. The head is two inches in height, fluffy, and recedes very slowly into a lot of sticky lacing. The aroma is of very hoppy for a doppelbock, or any other beer for that matter. Grapefruit, grass clippings, with hints of caramel and toffee underneath. The taste is a little maltier than the aroma, but is still dominated by hops. Caramel leads the way, but is soon cut in half by the sharp hop edge. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer for what the brewer intended it to be. A wiser BA than myself once said, \"I can tell you if a beer is high quality, and I can tell you if I like it, but the answer isn\\'t always the same.\" I can tell you that this is a high quality beer, but I am not a huge fan of hoppy doppelbocks. Still, props to the brewer for stretching the definition of beer.',\n",

Smells like tart cherry, melon, pale malt, whiff of roastiness. Pretty restrained. Taste is a sweet cherry, some malt, not a whole lot else. Lightly carbonated on a medium body; well done. Overall, this is a refreshing, tasty cherry beer, kind of like a mellower version of Wisconsin Belgian Red. I can see being put off by the sweetness or prominence of the cherry flavor, but what do you expect.',\n",

Coffee flavors are not as present as I wanted them to, chocolate is also a very large character. The chocolate in this is more sweet bakers chocolate rather than earthy chocolate malt flavor.

       "  'review/text': \"For those of us who know the history of this brew, and know Fred Karm's original recipe for Thirsty Dog's Siberian Night realize how contract brewing in Frederick brewing keeping the brand alive can kill what the beer was all about. Now enters Hoppin' Frog and all is right in the world. Appears pitch black motor oil that absolutely absorbs every band of the visible light spectrum where everything fades to black. Head is a dark brown mocha hue, forms thick. With my first gulp of the brew head is left evenly all around my Southern Tier pint glass. Aromatics bring out deep roasted malts with coffee and dark chocolate and the oatmeal adds that layer of cereal grain softness to the mix, while herbal hops flow as well. Sweet decadent creamy burnt marshmallows with singe of alcohol tickling the ol' nares. Flavor a rolling wave of oatmeal and roasted malt sweet and roasted malt bitterness. Creamy sweet syrup added to a bowl of plain oatmeal, with cocoa powder and flame roasted marshmallow added to the mix that's what this beer tastes like. After your first few sips you think where's the hops because in flavor only minimal herbal balancing hop flavor survives the malt trip, but by the third or fourth sip the hop burps arrive and you realize where those sixty international bitterness units are hiding. Huge yet perfectly balanced beer sweet and creamy yet roasty and hoppy, the ying and yang of all dark beers. Mouthfeel is huge creamy borderline custard at times, carbonation rolls sluggishly trying to move that high gravity around, you can tell when you watch the pour. It takes awhile for the head to form even after a vigorous pour. Drinkability is effortless even after 22oz I could have another glass. I learned this after having it on tap before it arrive in Pittsburgh. I made a beer run up to Boardman, OH to visit Ron Bush at his Diamond Bar where Boris was flowing. A couple glasses later had me owned by this brew, my second meeting with this fine brew came at Smokin' Joe's in the South Side after a Pirate's game, needles to say I tried to make this brew a session beer....I know I know...respect beer. By the way thanks to Valley Wine Cellar I can now by it in the city where I live for $7.99 a bottle, that's value.\",\n",

Interesting array of orange, honeydew melon, grassy, and minty hops. Can't keep my nose away from this. The taste is as the nose would suggest, a brash and ballsy hops first experience. Intense hop resins coat the tongue and beat down any malts that are trying to make themselves known. Creamy and full bodied. Finishes with a very assertive bitterness that you would expect for 100+ Ibu beer. The hefty avb is also cloaked under all the intese hop flavors. Finish is somewhat dry and chalky. Some tealeaf with honey sweetness is left on the tongue. This beer makes no apologies about what it is, an all out hop bomb. I would suggest this be your last of the nite though. My tongue is battered.Would love to try this with some Tai hot wings. So glad I got the chance to try this. Huge thanks to jjayjaye.\",\n",

Smokey and chocolaty. Excellent blend of coffee as well in the flavor. This is close to what i remember the KBS to be like, but less complex in my opinion. Lots of molasses and oats. Sweetness is offset with the right dose of bitterness. \\t\\tM - Mouthfeel doesn't follow the pour. Rather it's silky and really smooth. Not as heavy and thick as i expected it to be.

As the it warmed up, there was more and more strong dark fruit flavors especially plum, which combined with the alcohol gave it a somewhat boozy quality. \\t\\tM: As my palate grew more accustomed to the heavy malt bill, I noticed more of the subtle hop bitterness that was lying underneath.

Decent head that winds down quickly, leaving trails of lace, splotches acorss the top, and a thick and creamy ring around the rim. Captivating.\\t\\tN: Candied grapefruit and orange peel galore, though as it warms and you swirl the brew the citrus peel folds into a turkey gravy/faint malt blend that is kinda odd, along with some strong showings of almost ethyl-like alcohol. \\t\\tP: Rich malt and dopey hops are offset by strong citrus peel bitterness, sweet malt, caramel, and alcohol. The alcohol presence is sort of an underlying strength rather than a biligerant nuisance, but as the brew warms its presence becomes stronger and stronger. Long soft malt/citrus peel finish.\\t \\tM: Medium-soft carbonation that still holds up the brew, smooth and flowing, but not super luscious and tongue wrapping. Finish is long and smooth, citrus peel bitterness eventually wrangling for the takeover and winning. Leaves a strong bitter aftertaste, making this almost more of a digestive than an after dinner sip. \\t\\tNotes: Approach this like a strong IPA and you will be very, very disappointed. Approach this like a barleywine, and you might be pleasantly surprised. Sits well with warmth in the stomach, but big gulps may make you cough from the strength of the brew. Overall, quite pleasant, though I couldn\\'t help but wonder if there was something I wasn\\'t getting, almost like I was waiting for a third act that never came. Still, it\\'s getting cold outside and this brew tastes just fine to me. However, must be noited in the drinkability factor that one is not a) going to be drinking this nightly and b) this brew is so damn hard to find as it is that you must repeat a) again. \\t\\t(Music: Thin White Rope \"Spoor\")',\n",

Aroma has a nice roasty dark malt essence bringing out chocolate and a touch of cofee along with herbal hop character coming out in the finish. Taste has a creamy dark chocolate presence, mild cofee bitterness with more herbal grassy hop character finishing very dry but a bit sweeter overall than the typical dry Irish stout, I'm guessing due to the addition of the oats to the boil. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with even carbonation maintains an overall creamy texture during my drinking session with this brew.

Thanks! \\t\\t---\\t\\tSecond bottle, apparently 2009 vintage, received.... hmm, I don't know who gave this to me. I do appreciate it, because I enjoy this beer. \\t\\tA: Pours a murky reddish amber color with half an inch of off-white head. Retention is not so great, and the final appearance is a light film and thin collar on the brew, with some wisps of lacing down the glass. \\t\\tS: Wow, this bourbon-barrel aged, all right. Loads of caramelly bourbon, vanilla, nuts, buttery oak. The barrels overwhelm the base beer here, but it's still good. \\t\\tT: The initial taste is a boozy, burnt bourbon-caramel sweetness with hints of raisin and chocolate. It's hoppy, but not in any distinct fashion; just enough to keep the beer from getting cloying. There is a nutty, buttery vanilla component in the mid-taste that reflects the barrel contribution. The tannins are soft and muted; in a discussion I ventured a guess that French oak had been the source of the wood. The aftertaste is lightly tannic with some lingering hop bitterness (kind of earthy). I'm not pretending for a second that this is a balanced brew; it is very bourbon-forward. Lots of strong flavors here. But they're well-meshed. This would be a pretty excellent cigar beer, I think. \\t\\tM: Medium-full bodied, with low carbonation that gives it a creamy mouthfeel. The heat is obvious; there is a definite warmth in the finish that takes away from this category. \\t\\tD: A phenomenal beer. I had this side by side with Dirty Bastard, and I loved the way the barrels change this one. I will seek out more in the future.\",\n",

There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The aroma is mostly sweet, the brew smells like roasted malt, dark fruit, chocolate and vanilla. The taste isn't as sweet compared to the aroma, however the sweet flavors do show up a little more as the beer warms up (I did let the bottle sit out after taking it out of the fridge for about 30 minutes before opening it). It tastes like bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and some sugar and grassy hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it has good carbonation. I think it's a decent brew and worth trying, but nothing about this brew really stood out to me especially with the number of good imperial stouts out there.\",\n",

       "  'review/text': 'Presentation: A very distinctive looking, and rather uniquely sized bottle at 1 Pint, 9.87 fluid ounces, or 765ml if youre into metric units. A single obverse label has a gold & copper coloring with the words Stoudts Abbey Double above it. Labeled as Bottle-Conditioned Ale. A smudged bottom right hand corner of the label states, Vintage Date 6/4/03.\\t\\tAppearance: A turbid caramel-brown body, perfectly demonstrating the fact that this beer is unfiltered. A tan colored head quickly forms when poured, and soon settles to a thin collar. Above average carbonation means that the head is easily replenished when the beer is quickly swirled. \\t\\tNose: Caramel malts, spices, yeast, dark fruits and some sweet molassic hints at times when the beer is swirled. Average in strength.\\t\\tTaste: A lovely spicy introduction, that is so typical of the Belgium Dubbel style, is immediately wrapped in a smooth, slightly warming, caramel malt middle. The spices rise in strength towards the middle. I frequently got a tart, sour hint  making me think this could be on the turn. With the smudged date  its hard to tell. The ending has a slightly sweet-bitter angle, with a dry yeast aspect  the characterful spice is still there though. Astringent at the death.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Above average, smooth and often creamy  but also mildly warming. The tartness I mentioned above puzzles, one minute its there, the next its gone.\\t\\tDrinkability: Very nice, its mild warming effect, and spicy aspect lends a fruity dimension to the beer and aids its Drinkability. \\t\\tOverall: An accomplished example of the style and a decent attempt  the spicy hints from the Belgian yeast makes all the difference I think. Cheers Nero!!',\n",

       "  'review/text': \"I didn't get heavy into craft until early 2011, so this is my first time sampling this one. Poured into a nonic pint...\\t\\tA: Well, Harvest Ale is a great looking IPA, with its beautiful straw golden color that tilts just a shade to the copper side, but only slightly. So very slightly. A truly pleasing half finger white head erupts from a moderate pour. Its thick, gobby, and bubbly. Complementary lacing sticks to the sides of my pint glass. Harvest Ale, just look at you ya big dumb bastard! A fine looking IPA.\\t\\tS: I'm getting a strong dose of pine, some spiffy grapefruit zest, and just a dash of herbal grassiness on the nose. It doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it is well balanced and hits the right notes. And it makes me want to drink it. Now.\\t\\tT: Oh wow, did Founders just eclipse Double Trouble? Because my first impressions tell me hell yes. This is fantastic. A big, bold, juicy IPA you can sink your teeth into. It combines bright, citrus notes that I have always cherished in this style with herbal, grassy bitterness that must be implied by this beer's namesake. This is simply fantastic. Pine needles, grapefruit zest, a touch of lemon, and an herbal bitterness that actually pleases my palate instead of making me wince in disgust. WTF, mate?!? This is 6.5% ABV?!? Could have fooled me. A spectacularly complex and satisfying IPA for the ABV here. Wow.\\t\\tM: It's one of the first lessons my good friend Rhettroactive taught me, and I have to say I never fully appreciated it until now....Founders always nails mouthfeel. Their beers, even the ones that miss the mark (I'm talking to you, Cerise), are always always ALWAYS well-balanced. Harvest Ale is no exception. There's a great interplay here between the citrus and herbal notes used on this that carries all the way through to a lingering finish that is both dry and sweet at the same time. As stated earlier, this is a beer to sink your teeth into. Nice use of malt, too, to give the hops a canvas to splash their color upon.\\t\\tO: Founders Harvest Ale is another kick-ass IPA from Founders. There's not much more I can say. Seek it out and drink it. Bountifully.\",\n",

Served at cellar temperature, 45 degrees F.\\t\\tPours a beautiful deep copper-amber hue with a small half-finger of slightly off-white foam that doesn't linger, fading to a thick crown that fails to stick very well, leaving behind only small, sporadic splotching on the walls of the glass.\\t\\tAroma is magnificent; I'd even venture as far as dream-like. Bourbon notes take center stage here, and they are big and bold, with lots of vanilla and faint traces of alcohol. Sitting right behind the Bourbon notes are those of sweet maple. Quite exquisite, making a sip difficult to resist.\\t\\tBody is quite full but not heavy; carbonation is mild, but there is just enough there to give a little pep to this heavy-hitter. Up front sweet malt makes a brief appearance before the barrel aging really shines through again. Vanilla notes are massive here, though not overpowering, and they stretch easily from start to finish. The maple on the palate is a bit more subdued than in the nose, but it stands present just after the malt begins to subside and just before the hops kick in, which combine with an immediate boozy warmth to balance out the sweet side and dry things a good bit. At the back the Bourbon character really picks up, sliding down the back with a Bourbon-vanilla-alcoholic fade (which burns just a little on the throat) in a finish that really shows off the aging character extremely well. At the finish, it's almost easy to forget that this is a beer and not a snifter of Kentucky whiskey.\\t\\tDrinkability is severely hindered due to the strong alcoholic presence and content as well as the overall strength of character, and this is certainly something that I probably could only put back one of, two max. That said, this is certainly one of the most characterful and delightful beers I've had the pleasure of trying to date. Founders has done an amazing job here, and I must say that I'd love to try the syrup that was aged in these barrels prior to their acquisition by the brewery. Simply world class.\",\n",

The hop bitterness expands across the top and sides of my palate and linger. \\t\\tM - Medium bodied with a perfect amount of warming alcohol and moderate carbonation. \\t\\tD - This beer really disappeared quickly. I find it highly drinkable and very well balanced. If anything, I think it needs a bit of a citrus hop kick to balance out the pine, but that's a minor quibble.

       "  'review_body': 'I am always looking for unique items that will WOW my grandchildren when they come to visit. This Magic Ball light is fun; it fills a room or tent with light and the automatic sound activation has my Grandchildren singing their hearts out, then giggling and laughing. Priceless!<br /><br />This has been thoroughly tested and approved by all of my grandchildren over the last couple of months and never seems to lose its appeal. It would make a nice inexpensive gift for any child for their room.<br /><br />1. RoHS, CE certified<br /><br />2. This is made of heavy plastic and has a 5 inch diameter and is 5 1/8th inches tall, it has a clear dome and colored LED lights shoot from the dome in addition to a ring of LED lights around the bottom which in combination create a two dimensional light show.<br /><br />3. The bottom is made with 2 indented screw holes and an indentation for the cord so it is easy to hang on the wall or ceiling, or just plug it in and set it on a stand.<br /><br />4. There are a total of 51 LED lights in Red, Green and Blue that rotate and fill the room with lights, for its price and size this is a very nice little light with a big light show that my Grandchildren love.<br /><br />5. There is also automated sound activation that changes the light show to match the music or at my house the songs my grandchildren sing to get the lights to speed up and change. This sound activation is not as sensitive as some lights I have tried and doesn’t pick up every nuance however it is a wonderful feature and I love hearing my three year old singing. The giggling and laughing Priceless.<br /><br />6. There are two things that I would change on this, the cord is only 35 inches long and there is no on/off switch or sound activation switch. I have it plugged into a surge protector with a switch on it so it is not constantly being plugged in and unplugged.<br /><br />Received a free sample for evaluation and unbiased review.',\n",

And it had the hologram in the back... I recently returned it because the finish was chiping, and they gave me a new one that is waaaay darker in color, and it does not have the hologram in the back, is this because it's older? The manufacture date says 9/14 ... Is that on the older side ? Did I get one that is not fully featured? Now I regret returning the original guitar I fell in love with.../:/  Awesome, amazing guitar... Blown away by the quality and attention to detail... And of course... The SOUND! But mine, I got a chip on the finish and I swear that happened inside the case... I had just cleaned it and it was all perfect, then I took it out and it had a big ol chip.... Such a shame, very beautiful finish\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"Great beginners mandolin, I play guitar and wanted to get out of a creative rut and learn something new. I was originally looking at the cheapest mandolin available (won't mention any names) and based on recommendations from players on mandolin blog and chat sites decided to go one level up. Boy am I glad I did because I found this beauty. I found the fit and finish on this mandolin outstanding with no blemishes. The Tabaco sunburst is subdued compared to a standard sunburst, I like that. It only needed a quick tuning and intonation setup and it was ready to play. A real bonus is its amp and recording ready. The picture shows what appears to be a standard single coil magnetic pickup but mine came with a under saddle piezio pickup and it sounds great amped. Make no mistake, this is an entry level mandolin but that is exactly what I wanted as I wasn't sure if I would continue to play it for the long term. Now I'm sure I will continue to play this mandolin frequently and hopefully for a very long time.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"The Fishman Aura Spectrum DI preamp is a must-have if you play an acoustic/electric guitar. The difference in tone from an under-saddle pickup or sound-hole pickup is simply amazing! You DO actually get a microphone sound and any piezo pickup &#34;quack&#34; or electronic-produced sound can be blended out of your guitar's pickup. I have Takamine acoustic-electric guitars and Guild acoustic-electric guitars and they sound exceptional when plugged into this preamp. Before you purchase this preamp, go to Fishman's website (http://www.fishman.com/products/view/aura-spectrum-di) and review the product information and then download the Aura Gallery III to your computer and scan through all the selections available to you for use with your guitar. Some very high-end microphones were used by Fishman to develop this imaging preamp ($4,000 microphones in some cases). Also, browse Youtube to find out more about this preamp....you won't regret your purchase of this preamp. One additional bit of advise......before you decide to spend money for a new guitar, buy this preamp and &#34;dial in&#34; some images to play through your old guitar. I think you'll find that you won't need a new guitar after having a chance to hear your old guitar plugged into this preamp and run through your PA or amplifier.  If you want your acoustic-electric guitar to sound like it is being recorded in a studio with high-end microphones, this is your preamp!\",\n",

I have this Marshall set up in my bedroom, 11x14.  Centered on the headboard wall with at least 6&#34; off the backside.  I get serious distortion if I try and crank it up past 4-5 on the Volume.  Does it sound crisp and clear when below that volume?  Absolutely.  However, I have heard numerous Bose Waves cranked up in the same environment and there is simply no comparison.  Will I keep this Marshall?  Yup.  Looks cool and at least meets my minimum expectations.\",\n",

So I bought this, for just a couple dollars, so see what an octave harmonica sounded like.  The quality of this is not very good, with some notes not playing the upper octave, and it takes a LOT of air to play.  So much so that it is hard to sustain a note for even a full second.  I really don't see this as a playable instrument, and to give this to a beginner would probably just frustrate them.  I did end up buying another octave harmonica by Tombo, and the difference was like night and day... much easier to play.... but also much more expensive.  In hindsight I probably wasted my money on this, but maybe I might take it apart someday and see if I can get it to pay properly.\",\n",

Could not be lowed enough it would come undone from the pickup and still to high it still hit the strings. I had to use a pickup mounting plate that I had. The one I had was vintage witch matched the binding great and is much lower in height then the black one that came with it. The bridge is slammed  down to the bottom and still the strings are to high. Looking for a lower bridge, but it is now playable. It is a great looking guitar much better looking then any Fender squire, vintage or standard or other wise. Just has cheep bridge hardware. the bridge design is bad with the hardware used. The pickup are not that great sound cheep. will be changing them as well. Then I will have the Tele of my dreams',\n",

Who cares if it's a real iRig if it's still crap?<br /><br />The one I got did come in an iRig package if that for some reason matters to you.  But it cracks a lot while recording and there almost no isolation between the headphones and microphone.  So expect anything sent to your headphones (like maybe a metronome click track) to also be recorded (at a slightly lower volume than your actual input).<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it is really cheap, so I don't feel like I was really ripped off.  It may have some limited uses for someone out there.\",\n",

This required a very narrow and carefully shaped stream of air.<br /><br />It's hard to be sure-- an experienced player might be able to get much nicer sounds out of it-- but I think it is a fairly limited instrument for beginners. In comparison, you can buy a plastic soprano recorder for anywhere from about 3 or 4 dollars to about 30 dollars. A 30-dollar plastic soprano recorder is a very good instrument, better than wood recorders up to five times as expensive. A 5-dollar plastic recorder is a toy-- even the best of recorder players can't really make music on it. I suspect that this danso is comparable in quality to a low-end plastic recorder, but I don't really know that for sure, not having played a better instrument. It doesn't seem capable of much variation in loudness or tone color.\",\n",

I love this little night like it is just bright enough too be able to see when you walk through the living room to go to the bath room. I love how it is small but packs a powerful light. This is a great product and it does have several modes i use the light off mode. So when light turns off it comes on. It takes 3 AAA which are not included. It does have 3 other modes but I haven't messed with them much as this one works wonders for our family. I got this at a discount for my unbiased review.\",\n",

You can adjust the record levels so (my grand piano) your sound source does not overwhelm the device and cause crackles in the playback.  You can also record as .mp3 at varying levels of precision (ie memory space), same for .wav.  And you can convert one to the other within the device.  The visual interface is not that user friendly, but the user manual is comprehensive.  And you can download onto your PC and upload onto iTunes, creating your own playlists of your playing or send .mp3s to friends or teachers over email to let them hear your progress.  Plus just listening to myself from a recording is so edifying.  I love this little device.  Came fast and free with Prime.  Thanks Amazon!',\n",

So because I am a electronic technician I decided to try and fix the M1R EX synthesizer module rather than send it back. Ultimately I was able to restore the card loader but it was really in need of replacing. I put a battery in it and all was well for storing the loaded memory. Also the picture that they posted of this unit was not the same one that I received. The unit needed a lot of restoration work before I could look at it with a pleasing eye, but I was able to restore it. This is not they way to do business by lying about the product your are trying to sell and charging way too much for something that they knew didn't work to begin with.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': 'This is one of the two best plastic soprano recorders available, and is a much better value for the money than less expensive plastic sopranos. The only plastic soprano comparable to it is the 300 series Yamaha soprano. Personally, I prefer the range of tone color on the Yamaha, but this instrument also has a good range of tone color. The great advantage of this instrument over the Yamaha is that there are several pitches which tend to be problematic on all recorders-- even good wooden instruments-- especially the high C near the top of the instrument, and the G# below that-- and these pitches sound quite clearly and easily on this instrument. I would choose it over the Yamaha for any piece involving fast passage work in the top register.<br /><br />There are better wooden instruments, of course, but one has to pay at least $100 for anything better than this. I think it is a great fortune to be able to buy an instrument this good for between $20 and $30 (the price fluctuates quite a bit), and I would recommend it without hesitation to anyone who wants to learn to play the recorder, or to any experienced player who wants a plastic instrument as a backup.',\n",

       "  'review_body': \"I have relied on the Snark tuners for years because they are reliable and inexpensive enough where I can keep one in each instrument's case. However, the notion of polytuning sparked my curiosity, and I found this device helpful. It has a couple of problems. Sometimes, when I strum all the strings, not all of them appear on the display. It also often happens that after individually tuning each string, I notice that strumming suggests that a couple of strings may be instantly out of tune again. For the most part, however, I have found tuning much easier and quicker with this device than with the Snark tuners. Also, although it is meant for six-string guitars, I found it an accurate tuner for my twelve-string guitar and mandolin, although the polytune function, of course, does not work for those.\",\n",

I just did an outdoor gig with it on my acoustic, and the accuracy and functionality of the readout surpassed anything else I have used (Snark, Intellitouch, etc.) I was in bright sunlight, and I could read the display no problem. As I tuned each string, the display needle held steady and guided me to a more accurate tuning than I used to get with the Snark-and it was quicker too. The &#34;polytune&#34; function is useful, but it is not the real star of the show. The real reason to buy this tuner is because it works way better than it's competition, and is easy to read. Not sure yet if it is as good or better than the TC or Boss pedal tuners (both excellent), but it is certainly close.\",\n",

When I first got the Icicle, I noticed that there is zero metal on the body of the device - it's all chrome-painted plastic. And the particular device I received was rattling as if something inside was broken. So first off, the build quality makes it feel like a cheap toy. The recording quality was okay, albeit a bit noisy, for higher-pitched instruments. HOWEVER, when recording warm, lower-pitched instruments, like timpani and marimba, the Icicle provided its own soundtrack of buzzy feedback that could not be fixed, no matter what settings I tried. I bought a $400 mic for this recording project, and this Icicle made it sound like a $50 mic. If you need a quick, cheap device for simple, lo-fi recordings, this would be it - but you're wasting your money if you think you can get a good quality recording from this toy.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"just received this amp today Aug 31, 2015.<br />Using this amp primarily for electronic Pyle Pro PED02 drums.<br />Very loud, plenty of punch power for small to medium size crowds, maybe even larger crowds.<br /><br />Amp has plenty of preset sounds to choose.<br />I'm really a big fan of the TurboSound brand quality.<br />Good solid thump and great low and mid tone.<br />The tweeter does produce that high end thrash from drum cymbals.<br />Both speakers throw out a very realistic sound.<br />I've also used this amp for my guitars too and the rocks out like a pro.<br /><br />The sub woofer output jack is very good to have and my Pyle Pro drums have a few preset sound modes that produce very low end sub woofer sound. So hooking a powered sub woofer to this amp really let the system blast clearly with powerful muscle.<br />The quality is instantly noticeable just looking at it. The functions and sounds prove it.<br /> I would give this amp a 10 star rating if I could and I highly recommend this for the frugal consumer. The cost seems high but really not if<br /> comparing the quality and the expected years of use from it.<br /><br />pro's - just a good powerful amp with great sound.<br /><br />cons - I don't really care for the preset sound button and having to scroll through so many to get the desired effect.<br />example: wanting to quickly switch between modes takes time.<br />  alternative is to choose the sounds I prefer and use each sound on each of the out pout channels, then just turn on or up the channel<br />  output that I want for the moment and play. Since there's only four output channels, my choices are limited.<br />  But I'm okay with it since the Amp is such a nice quality build.\",\n",

       "  'review_headline': 'My long search for headphones is over - the Focal Spirit Pros are the ones for me.',\n",
       "  'review_body': \"I have tried a lot of different headphones.  My main ones for years were Beyerdynamic DT770s.  I borrowed three sets of Ultrasones (ranging in price from $700-$1500) from a friend.  These made me realize how much high end definition was missing in my DT770s.  At the same time, the mids sounds horribly scooped in the Ultrasones.  The Focal Spirit Professional headphones are giving me the best of both worlds.  Simply put, they sound balanced from top to bottom.  The detail is there.  And I have to say the transient response is better than any other headphones I've heard.  They're also incredibly efficient.  I let my friend who lent me the Ultrasones check out the Focals, and he, within a very short duration of listening to them, decided he needed a pair.<br /><br />The only downside is they're not the most comfortable headphones to wear for extended periods of time.  I guess I was spoiled in that regard with my DT770s.<br /><br />Anyway, these are winners for me.\",\n",

I needed the mic and couldn't go without it, so I requested that a new pad be sent. I sent them photos that it was missing a pad and had zero adhesive residue meaning it was never on. The customer service person made it sound like they could send one out. Then I received an email a couple days later stating I had to send the whole thing back. I responded to that email of asking why and I haven't heard anything back from them for the past 3 weeks.<br /><br />*Pic* Gotta love the missing pad on the bottom of the stand right next to the sticker &#34;QC Passed&#34;... says something doesn't it.<br /><br />The mic itself is 5 star for price and use, but minus one star for the lack of Quality assurance/quality control on the stand and minus another star for customer service not being able to simply send one adhesive pad to fix their mistake and not responding to emails for weeks on end.\",\n",

Turning the soul food side to low gain cleaner sound, increases harmonic response without over coloring the sound while allowing the guitar volume to have great control of the tone.  3 pedals in the loop, a Pork Loin, JRC4558D pedal and then a delay.  With a flip of the switch everything can get tossed upside down with the reverb first -&#62; effects loop -&#62; soul food as the post gain.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and sit down with this to get it dialed in.  Decent sounding gain, but gets a tad grainy when dimed.<br /><br />Pros:  Good tone, easy to operate, controls pretty straight forward.  Effects loop and order of effects switch can do unusual things, mess around with this before playing live and changing it up.  One of the best reverb replacement pedals I have ever heard.  Good pedal to be PAIRED with other overdrives.<br /><br />Cons: Does not play well with solid state amps or modeling effects.

       "  'review_body': \"I bought the 211A because I have very small hands, and my hands start aching after a while when I play a normal tenor (wooden or plastic) with wider reaches and keys for the low C and C#. I also dislike the clicking sound those keys tend to make on a plastic tenor. Since I have many other excellent Aulos instruments, including their plastic imitation Grenser Baroque flute, I had high expectations for this one.<br /><br />I have to say that I was disappointed. It is certainly easy to play, but its tone quality is not even remotely comparable to the tone quality of the Yamaha 300 series plastic tenor recorder which I play most of the time. I would still have given it a four-star rating except for one thing: it has no high C# ! That's right, the second to top note in the standard range of the instrument is simply missing. The standard fingering doesn't work for it, and the fingering chart from Aulos which came with the instrument omits this pitch. I tried other fingerings, and nothing worked. I did find a fingering online which involves stopping the end of the instrument with one's knee (one can get an entire extra octave above the standard range using fingerings like that), but I have never considered this practical for normal performing.<br /><br />D major is a fairly common key in early music (many of the early flutes had D as their lowest pitch instead of C), so the fact that the high C# is missing is a serious problem for anyone interested in playing Renaissance and Baroque pieces. Taking that together with the unimpressive tone color, I think this instrument rates only three stars. If the high C# isn't important to you, take my rating as a four star rating instead.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"After spending a fair amount of money getting my guitars set up, I decided I was going to get a basic set of guitar tools and learn to do it myself.  All I really needed at the moment was a way to measure string action, I wont be doing any fret or nut work at the moment, and there are other tools that are perhaps similar, but as soon as I opened the package up I knew I had made a good choice, this thing oozes precise and is very well constructed.  It's super easy to get a precise bead on your string action. It's nice to know that this tool will be there if I ever take my guitar repairing to the next level and get to use some of the other features of this great little tool.\",\n",

Before buying the SW118V woofer, we played these gigs with a Yamaha EMX512SC powered mixer plus 2 Yamaha 15 cabs on sticks. Adding the SW118V has improved our sound immeasurably. We run mono with the mains driving the 2 15s and the monitor send driving the SW118. We mic everything now (which we couldn't do before), including guitar, kick/snare and bass. Kick and bass go primarily in the monitor send to the 118; guitar and vocals into the main send to the 2 15s. It smooths out the sound remarkably, making even outdoor gigs sound like a bona fide full-production mix. The difference really is remarkable.

       "  'review_body': \"No matter what price range, Yamaha seems to maintain excellent manufacturing standards to ensure well-built instruments.<br /><br />Now, this is the low end of their price range, so they certainly use lower grade materials to keep the price down, but Yamaha still manages to make the instrument look &#34;nice&#34;, i.e. paint the backside and neck matte black to cover the not-so-pretty wood used.<br /><br />Does it look fantastic? No. There's little bumps and divots on the neck if you look really close, but the instrument still is very presentable. The spruce top looks nice.<br /><br />Sound: okay, so there's some complaints about the APXT2 not having a full sound, especially in the lower range. Well no kidding, folks. It's a 3/4 guitar, though the body is even smaller than other brands' 3/4 guitars. Think Jethro Tull's &#34;Thick As A Brick&#34; guitar opening; the small-body Martin Ian Anderson uses is what this guitar's sound reminds me of---which I like! It has its purpose.<br /><br />Plugging it in: I do not have an acoustic amp, so I will refrain from giving much assessment here, but I did plug it into my Peavey Classic 30 tube amp and there was no buzz or anything like that. My guess is it would be just fine with the proper amplification.<br /><br />Pros: good sound, very playable, aesthetically pleasing, on-board tuner works well.<br /><br />Cons: tuning machines are sloppy, which is probably the cause of it slipping out of tune a bit between playing sessions<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this guitar for anyone looking for a lighter sound, something to noodle on, travel with, etc. Good for small hands or children too!\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"My favorite strings! Great tone! I play an Ibanez AFJ85 hollowbody, the D'Addario Jazz Light Chromes have a warm mellow tone which is great since my guitar is naturally bright being a hollowbody. The texture of the flat wounds are smooth and easy on the fingers, perfect for rhythm and lead, especially if you play fast. These are the longest lasting strings I've played, I change them out about every 2-3 months and I play my guitar almost daily. Im a worship leader at church, the strings sound great playing live on stage. My main style of playing is a mix of rockabilly and old school punk, but they're also perfect for jazz and blues. I first learned about these strings when I bought my guitar a few years ago, they came stock. Been using the D'Addario Jazz Light Chromes ever since! I have heard of people using them on solid bodies but I have not tried flat wounds on my solid body guitars. But I do recommend them on hollowbodies.\",\n",

I have had this amp about 3 months now and it seems to be holding up very well with no degradation in sound quality, even though I have knocked it off my desk onto hardwood flooring at least 5 or 6 times which is really telling of the build quality!

Being 'open' gives it a more midrange tone that cuts through more than a temple block or Jam Block at a lower volume. But, the sweet spot on these Blast Blocks is smaller and requires more finesse to play the way you want. Plays well with all LP's other blocks. If you could only have ONE, I'd go for the large green version of this, but the green and yellow complement each other very well, and are both worth it for any serious percussionist, despite the price tag.\",\n",

We were using a kitchen chair, this is a vast improvement.  He has tipped it over once getting off, but now he is just more careful.  I'm sure it would also be a good bench for adults. The only downside is that it's vinyl, and after a while you kind of stick to it.  It's pretty easy to just put a towel down though.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"I purchased the khaki model two months ago (same bag, different color). In that time I have taken it to eight jams and on over thirty gigs and the bag has held up wonderfully. This one is perfect for female drummers (and more than a few show up at jams in my local area). That statement is based on the color. The design is for any drummer, and especially we jazz drummers who do not need a bag full of spare sticks.<br /><br />It holds just enough. The interior is lined, and the pockets are divided into a pair that have clear plastic on the back that is good for sticks, mallets and brushes, and a mesh pair of pockets in front of those for items like drum keys, additional sticks, mallets and brushes, and other small odds and ends. I have mine populated with two pairs of sticks and a pair of mallets in the clear plastic pockets, and a pair of brushes on one side and a drum key on the other in the mesh pockets.<br /><br />A big plus is you can hang this off a floor tom without affecting that drum's resonance. I own some high end, leather bags and while those look cool, they have a noticeable affect on how my floor tom sounds. this one does not.<br /><br />Every seam is nicely stitched and the nylon zipper is smooth. The fabric itself is either synthetic or cloth that has been treated because there is a slight chemical odor when I first opened mine. That goes away after a few hours, and the fabric is water resistant because of either the composition or the treatment (I am not sure which, but I view it as a major plus either way.) There are also reinforcement points that appear to make this a sturdy and long lasting bag.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"My foray into vinyl started quite modestly; my mother gave me one of those &#34;four in one&#34; wooden Crosley players that had a record player on top. From there I began collecting, and I decided to upgrade to something that took up less real estate on my dresser top and sounded better. I bought the Ion as opposed to one of the many Crosley options and I'm pleased with it. The speakers are small, but the fidelity is quite good and not tinny which I somewhat expected. The added usb connectivity isn't what I bought it for but if you plan on converting your collection it should suffice well enough. At time of review I've had and used this player for around a month and I'm happy with it. The volume isn't an issue despite the speaker size and the quality of playback is better than my old Crosley which is all I could ask for. If you're looking for top notch quality sound this likely isn't for you. But as someone who isn't willing to break the bank for barely negligible audio quality, this player suits my needs, and likely anyone else starting out listening to vinyl as a hobby.\",\n",

I plugged these in yesterday before I got ready to put them around my pool deck and was blown away.<br /><br />Also, when you have the lights set to the music setting the colors will change just to your voice there is not plugging them into a phone or radio for it to work.

It feels great to hold and is comfortable to play. It looks like no other Uke out there and in short, has a very mellow sound for a plastic instrument. I like it a lot but the tuners are a little sloppy, not the best quality. The gig bag is a very nice addition and not some burlap sack with a logo on it. Like all my other plastics Ukes, this one has a permanent place in my rotation and is loads of fun to strum. Kudos for the unique and easy string slots on the bridge.

I purchased two of these to use as front fills for festival shows, and even as mains for small coffee shop  and DJ gigs. First off, construction is solid. The plastic enclosure is sturdy and the grill is extremely quality feeling. The aesthetic of these speakers is hard to top - they just blend in and look great everywhere. Sound quality is outstanding both for recorded music playback and for live sound. The deep mode is a fun feature, although I rarely get use out of it for my purposes. These speakers are lightweight and easily managed by any adult of remotely normal size.<br /><br />Input options are wonderful, with two inputs (mic/line switch is handy!) that have independent gain knobs and can be summed into a mono output for daisy chaining. RCA inputs are useful for hooking up an external music source, and the power cable included has a locking feature to prevent it from being pulled out accidentally.<br /><br />For those who would question the price of these speakers, or the sound output of an 8 inch speaker I just have to say try and see! If a local music shop has these, definitely give them a listen because they are very loud and very clear for such a small, lightweight box. Well worth the price of admission!\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"Let me save you a lot of headache and hours of frustration. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. I bought this mixer from amazon and was excited to plug it in and try it out with my Behringer C-1 Microphone. This seemed like a cheap alternative to an audio interface and I liked the built in compressor. However, when I tried to record, there was a loud hissing noise present in all my recordings. I tried everything. Setting the gain up properly, resetting the levels, installing the driver Behringer recommends, chaging the settings. I even unplugged the mic and listened on headphones. With no mic plugged in, there is still a hiss. I looked online and was sad to discover that this is a common problem with Behringer mixers and THERE IS NO REMEDY. I tried all the suggestions and none of them work. Now, let me tell you how severe this problem really is. I unplugged from the USB port. The hiss is still in the headphones. I backed all the gain down and only turned on the Main Mix. Still there. I am disgusted with Behringer and will avoid Behringer mixers in the future. I will just have to shell out another 100 bucks and buy an audio interface. Save your money. Don't purchase Behringer USB mixers. And don't take my word for it. Google &#34;Behringer USB Mixer Hiss&#34; and see how many results pop up.\",\n",

After a while, I started to notice an extremely high pitched noise emanating from the device.  I am positive that the noise is coming from the device and not something else because it is only audible when the device is plugged into my computer.  I tried different wires, re-installing the drivers again to no avail.

If your looking to go for a bass headset always go for Sennheiser headphones/speakers they may look beefy, or big... But they are the true bass speakers/headphones you seek.<br /><br />When you put them on, it practically can be referred to as listening to an ocean in a sea shell, it feels weird when you put them on it's very noise cancelling...<br /><br />Now here's the big beef... When you want to listen to music while you wear these, in a library, on a plane, anywhere... It's just not going to work. If you plug this headset into your MP3 player even if the volume is lower than 5% the music you are listening too is still very clearly heard to people around you, when you set the volume to 100% it practically becomes a speaker! Literally, no joke.<br /><br />Very durable, I could've seen this sticking around for a very long time if I hadn't returned it. But I see no reason to include 90 degree swiveling earcups, well I could see how it's still relevant if you turn the volume to 100% and then you can face the music outwards... But other than that, the swiveling earcups can be annoying as a lot of the times I had them, the swiveling earcups were facing the wrong way and I had a lot of trouble trying to face the earcups inwards facing each other.\",\n",

Needless to say I quickly unplugged it and prepped it to be shipped back. I'm posting this review as a one star for now, but I've elected to get a replacement shipped and give the product another shot, at which point I will update this. I've read a lot of good things about this particular device, so I'm a bit sad that mine appears to be a lemon. Other than the fact that something's obviously wrong with the electronics on mine, the build quality doesn't seem too bad at all.\",\n",

At first I was pissed off because I thought the short straight cable was broken, but then I realized I wasn't screwing it in far enough...you need to screw it up past the &#34;pop&#34; noise that tells you the plug has clicked in, and then to screw it up just a tad more until it seats firmly.  I wasn't screwing it in all the way because it felt like I was going to strip it if I went any further, but I finally just cranked it in there, and it worked. It's cool they used the screw thread feature to either use the adapter or seat the plug firmly into the headphones.<br /><br />The sound is incredible for the price.  I wish they would make this same design in a chrome green!\",\n",

The clean tone is great, close enough to my '69 Traynor Custom Reverb and '99 Fender Prosonic.  The gain with a strat is clean up until about halfway and then it comes on fast.  Basically, this amp reminds me of my buddy's OR50 except not quite as huge sounding but pretty damn close.  You could totally gig with this, or at the very least use it as a backup.

If I did have 7 guitars I wouldn't like having them so close. The directions to put this stand together were terrible, and mine came with one of the bars being slightly bent. This stand does fold for easy transportation if that is important to you, but because it folds it is more flimsy in my opinion. I would recommend getting this if you had two guitars minimum. With only one guitar on the stand, the stand still wiggles a bit when touched. The more guitars you have on it the more stable it is. My guitars on average cost me $325 each. If my guitars were more expensive I would probably look elsewhere for a guitar stand... maybe one more sturdy. However, this does the job for me and it makes my room look much more organized and pretty.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"I'm a beginning violin student at an age well beyond what most music teachers regard as too late to learn to play violin.  When I decided to explore the violin, I checked local music stores for violin rentals.  I found no choice in rental instruments and lots of used violins and bows but no real help in differentiating between those worth playing, even as a beginner violin student (though not to music).  I even checked a good number of other online rental companies as well as reviews of violins made by various makers offered by rental companies.  I finally called Kennedy Violins because they had such a wide choice of instruments and dealt mainly in violins.  My experience with Kennedy, now nearly a one year relationship, has been very positive.  Always very quick and courteous service with respect to choice of instrument, bow, and accessories.  Every delivery was received very quickly and every question answered completely on the spot (via email or telephone).  The terms of my Kennedy Violin rental are better than local stores offered plus Kennedy offered a much broader range of instrument choices.  And every penny (except insurance) that I pay in rental for up to two years can be credited to purchase of my rental violin.  A good reason to pick the best violin you can afford right from the start; always good advice to beginning instrument players.  I give Kennedy five stars for choices in instruments, helpful and objective advice, terrific service and competitive pricing better than some local music stores.\",\n",

They're a little more expensive than regular strings, but they're really nice sounding strings, and they feel really nice, too. They have a rich, clear tone, and they have a nice punchiness to them.<br /><br />If you've never tried flatwound strings before, give these a try. They do have a very nice, smooth feel, and they seem to decrease finger squeaking a bit too. Overall I am very pleased with these strings. They're easy to tune and play, and for flatwound strings, they sound surprisingly good.<br /><br />I've only used these strings for a little over a month now, and despite their slightly higher price, these strings are looking like they might end up being my go-to strings.<br /><br />If you have any questions about these strings, please feel free to ask, and I'll try my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.\",\n",

Once that was done although the earpiece stay on well, they are not comfortable. However, the pairing with my device was seamlessly. There was no interference even at a 30ft range. I use this to listen to music while cleaning around the house. Had a hard time with the volume/track buttons, couldn't access them while wearing the headphones. I was not impress with the audio quality, but it provided me with enough distraction while doing mundane task.  Notes: I received a complimentary product in exchange for my honest review.\",\n",

The screen rotates and adjusts on a swivel ball joint to accommodate almost any viewing angle that might be needed, a great improvement over previous models.<br /><br />It's very easy to use as well, as there's a single button that is used to toggle between Chromatic, Guitar, Bass, Ukulele and Violin modes. A simple hold of the button for 3 seconds turns it on and off, and there's a auto-off feature to save on battery. Plus, given that it's a clip on, there's no messing around with plugging in instrument cables or holding a tuner's mic close enough to hear -- the tuner is right on the headstock, right next to the pegs whenever you need it.<br /><br />Very easily worth the money -- I'm planning on picking up a second one to keep on my home-away-from-home guitars.\",\n",

So far she likes it, but I will give one caveat -- if you plan to use this with power cable, the included cable is too short to reach the ground for a stand-up keyboard player's music stand.  I will have to use a USB extension cable.  Only used i tone week, but am satisfied so far.  Also, in case you are wondering, each one of the adjustable arms has 2 leds and its own power button.  Push the button once, and one LED comes on.  Push it again, and both LEDs will be lit.  Push again, and it will turn off.  Update:  Light just over a year before it gave out.  One side of the light just blinks, and the 2 leds blink at different rates. On the other side, only one of the 2 leds still works.  So out of 4 leds, only one is working properly.  Had to replace.\",\n",

It will pick up hard desk vibrations, (which I'm sure can be fixed with a boom our mat) and distant sounds easily.

There is room for several music books on the outside, and there is a larger area that can hold larger music if you need it to.  Places for pens, pencils, rosin, mutes, and the tuner.  This case is balanced.  So even after adding my books to one side, it doesn't tip over like my previous case was constantly doing.  Feels durable, with thicker zippers and comfortable grips.\",\n",

Opened it up and looked inside very cheaply made plastic plug ends for amp & guitar. Says designed in Germany but all part are China junk..Will not last long if you unplug it much.

I have been unhappy with the sound of the sampled piano, and knew an upgrade to a Radial was probably my only choice. It was this past Sunday that I manage to find two of these units buried in a milk crate (alternate audio system for small on location events).  I just had to hear the difference between this DI, and the other inexpensive DI we were using. What was the difference? This thing made the piano sound like a real piano, and the chords were clear. The other cheap DI seemed to be muddy when chords were played. I quickly switched between the Rolls (and the other DI) in the middle of chord progressions in order to make certain I was making the right choice. I even added EQ to both DI units, and attempted to make them both sound as good as possible. I connected one of the L/R outs of the Keys to this box, and the other to the other DI. I alternated both faders up/down, and listened to the difference. The band asked me what sounded better, I responded with: The Rolls sounds like a piano.\",\n",

       "  'review_headline': \"As good a beginner guitar as you're likely to find for the price.\",\n",
       "  'review_body': \"I decided to try and learn some basic guitar and bought this R & B sunburst tele-style guitar in June (2015), after discovering that an electric is far easier to learn on than an acoustic (which I bought earlier).  There is a bewildering number of guitars out there, including beginner-level.  While I did not have the chance to personally try too many, I decided to buy this one based upon reviews, the Grover tuners and price (I paid less than $90 for it).<br /><br />The guitar arrived well-packed.  It came well set up, with all strings in tune; I have found that the guitar tends to stay in tune, and even when one or two strings go out-of-tune, they only go slightly flat or sharp, an easy correction.  The finish is nice, with a smooth neck.  I find the action quite easy for a beginner.  The pickups are silent, and I've not noticed any fret buzz. The guitar has a nice, solid feel to it, but without being too heavy.  The contoured back fits comfortably against the body when playing.  The tone, volume controls and toggle switch work well and smoothly.  The neck shows no curve or warpage.<br /><br />There are some flaws, although so far, they've been minor.  The triple-ply pickguard is nice, but there were some imperfections noticed; a few strands of fiber were embedded in it, apparently part of the injection molding process.  Not really noticeable except when looking hard.  The curved cut where the pickguard wraps around the bridge is slightly off; one end is about 3 or 4 milimeters wider than the other end.  I didn't even notice it until after having it a couple of months.  One problem that did occur was after about six weeks, the guitar quit outputting a signal.  I found the problem was in the cable plug jack.  The hotwire solder had come lose from the contact.  I carefully removed the cable jack cover and re-soldered the connection nice and solid.  This is apparently a common problem with cheaper guitars imported from Asia (this guitar is Chinese made).<br /><br />All in all, I have no regrets about buying this guitar.  It feels good to play, sounds better than expected, stays in tune and has performed as well as any entry-level electric guitar I've seen.  It even sounds much like a real Fender tele, as I found recently; I'm using a Vox AC4TV tube amp, and it sounds pretty sweet.  I would buy it again even at the currently higher price.<br /><br />Added Sept.30.  This review is specifically on the R&B Special Tele Style with tobacco sunburst finish.  It seems that this 'Special' is of better quality.  Based upon my favorable impression of this guitar, I ordered a strat-style version.  Immediately returned.  It is of Spruce plywood, lacks Grover tuners (cheap ones instead), wouldn't tune well and went right out of tune every time.  The R&B Special tele style deserves five stars, but not too sure about other models now.ut buying this guitar.

       "  'review_body': \"[[VIDEOID:1e52fe684d1099714139bd83d71bf5dc]]PROs:  Light and portable, puts out enough light to show up on my 10' ceiling, even with the lights on, great color and motion, varied settings<br />CONs:  I wish the microphone was more sensitive.  Probably good enough for a club, but I'm not blasting music THAT loudly in my living room<br /><br />  So far, I've run this projector for about six hours total, in about four sittings.  My six-year-old loves the thing.  He and his little cousin have occasional dance parties, and I get the feeling that this will be coming along with him next time he goes to visit.<br />  It's a small unit:  You're not going to be rocking the Fleet Center with this thing.  And yes, it only has red and green, and only a few programs.  But it's a whole lot of fun to watch, and the lasers are bring enough to show up on my walls and ceiling even with my lights on.  You can vary the speed of the prism's movement, from fairly hyperactive to full stop.  You can also turn on a strobe setting which is pretty fun.  My favorite setting is the sound-activated setting.  The lights seem to react somewhat randomly to the sound.  I just wish the unit's microphone was a bit more sensitive  The music has to be really loud or really close for it to trigger the lights.  Other than that, this unit works great.  I know it's cliche, but I can't wait to put on dark side of the moon and stare at the ceiling for a while...<br /><br />I received a complimentary sample of this stage light, allowing me to offer my honest review.  I hope my review, and the video attached, is helpful in making your decision.\",\n",

I have not experienced any rubbing or scratching, and that is with more than once finding my seven year old throwing my guitar into the stand in a hope I did not notice them playing it without permission. Aside from the, &#34;You need to learn to respect other people's property and musical instruments,&#34; discussion, it is all I can do not to smile as she has a great ear and  I think we will be getting her a guitar of her own and another one of these stands.\",\n",

Before checking the Sennheiser website, and being too cocky about my electronics repair ability, I took the earphone apart and ruined it! Sennheiser has instructions for taking the earphones apart, and they have replacement cable assemblies available for purchase. RTFM! I bought two more of these just so I will have a working pair available no matter what happens. Love these headphones.',\n",

       "  'review_body': \"These headphones certainly pump up the volume!  To be clear - I am listening mostly to my iPhone so I am not writing this review about the deep resonant bass or the clear highs that you might be after for serious listening.  This is just about sound, clarity and being able to hear distinct parts of the music at higher volumes.  Ear buds always seems to make loud music sound like a bunch of cats fighting.  These deliver clear music at higher volumes so I can actually make out the parts as intended.<br /><br />As a slightly odd example:  I used to wear ear buds under noise reducing &#34;ear muffs&#34; when I mowed the lawn.  I was trying to catch up on podcasts while I meandered around the yard for 2 hours.  Even under the ear muffs I could barely make out the spoken word (or any music I might be listening to).  Enter these CAD headphones.  I popped them on and listened to GOLF of all things and could hear the whispering announcers as if the lawn mower wasn't on.  And music sounded great too.  And without being at a volume loud enough to make my ears bleed.<br /><br />The stretchy coiled cord brings back memories of plugging into my old hi-fi back in the day and listening to Doors albums.  Now, it's a slightly updated iPhone, but mowing the lawn to &#34;Break on Through&#34; works just fine.\",\n",

Overall I definitely recommend this if you want to grab a guitar and start going.<br /><br />If I had to say something was wrong with it I would say the strap is too small for a giant guy.  I am 6'2&#34; and around 240 lbs very broad.  Also, the tuner is a pitch pipe but there are a plethora of free apps out there.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"Sounds okay, but I had numerous problems with this microphone.<br /><br />First, sections were just loose to begin with. Fortunately, I found I could tighten the bottom section and that improved.<br /><br />Next, both controls (the On/Off switch and the Volume control) fell off within in the first few minutes of working with them. To clarify, the caps or knobs fell off. The switch itself was still intact. But the caps and knobs are tiny rubber like pieces and could've easily been lost. It felt very cheap.<br /><br />Next, while it sounded good at first, I suddenly started getting some loud 60Hz hum. This was isolated to where the USB cord connected to the bottom of the mic. Reconnecting everything firmly reduced the hum but I don't know for how long.<br /><br />While the capsule seemed pretty solid and sounded okay, the rest of the mic felt cheap and poorly designed. I may take a day to play with it but the mic is very likely going back.\",\n",

In an apparent move to save themselves some money, what they sell now includes a cheap vinyl 1-pouch version that could very easily slip into the guitar and ruin it. It is NOT double sealed, as they repeatedly claim in the instructions!!!<br /><br />And based on the number of horror stories I've seen here about ruined guitars, there is simply NO way I'm going to trust this to humidify my expensive Olson. They must think their customers are stupid and/or insane.<br /><br />Shame on D'Addario and Planet Waves for this bait and switch. I'm returning it, and telling everyone I know to avoid this product.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"I have taught classical guitar for years and have used all sorts of electronic tuners ranging from the old analog Korgs to the newest ones.  This tuner will accurately tune your guitar to standard pitch (440 Hz) but I cannot get it to tune to a lower pitch such as 420.  I have fiddled with it for some time now, read the tiny printed instructions several times and still it will only tune at 440.  Also, I cannot get this tuner to give me a tuning sound when pressing both buttons at the same time.  It will read out &#34;440&#34; but no tone is emitted.  It clearly tells me what pitch my strings are and I can easily to down to D or C or whatever I choose, but for across the board tuning in a different Hz range I can't seem to get it to do that.<br /><br />What is nice is the clip itself.  It is made out of metal with rubber tips and seems to firmly clip onto the headstock of my my old Ramirez quite well and I don't feel like it will break.  I have broken off two Snarks already and though I love how a Snark tunes, I have found them to be too fragile for me.  This tuner seems to be able to take rough handling better.  The display is clear and bright and easy to see.<br /><br />This is a good tuner but for the price I want more options.  My tiny D'Addario guitar tuner is my favorite.  I think it cost about 12 bucks and will do everything I want it too including remaining at different Hz even after turning off and back on.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"This stand is very portable and is pretty simple to set up and take down. I like that it is all one piece. The only thing is that it can't hold much. It just holds my iPad in its Snugg case and maybe comes out a few millimeters over the edge. That works for me, but if you're looking for a stand to hold thick books, this won't work.<br /><br />UPDATE: I had this stand for about 10 months, used it 5 days a week (set up and taken down at least once each day), and two of the three screws are stripped. My tripod will unfold and stand fine, but I can't tighten it. That was the first one to go, and it still worked fine so I didn't really worry. However, the other day, I was setting up the actual stand part and I noticed that the screw that locked it in place wasn't really tightening or loosening. I could adjust it at the angle I wanted, and it'd just stay there. But that finally &#34;died,&#34; falling forward and letting my iPad fall to the floor (the iPad is ok!). The hardware was never the greatest quality but I really liked how easy it was to assemble and disassemble quickly, and how it came with a traveling bag. I decided to sacrifice portability in order to get a more heavy duty stand to withstand being set up and taken down every day.<br /><br />It would make sense that this can withstand being set up and taken down for longer than 10 months since that's what the big appeal with this is (since it comes with a traveling bag!). If it's something that you plan on using occasionally for one of those times when you're glad you have something on hand, then this is perfect. For my job, I need something more heavy duty.\",\n",

       "  'review_body': \"Fantastic tuner.  I bought one of the PolyTunes when they first came out and was blown away by the ease of checking the tuning of all six strings with a single strum, and how easy it was go from there to the identified out-of-tune strings and easily tune them individually.<br /><br />The PolyTune 2 supposedly provides increased accuracy, and also offers a strobe-like function, which allows for even greater tuning precision for users accustomed to that approach.  I tested its accuracy using my Peterson Strobe Tuner - a very accurate tuner - and the found the Polytune 2 to be right on target across the board.  Finally, while the red/green lights of the original Polytune and regular Polytune 2 are plenty bright in their own right, I really like the blue/white combination even better.  Best pedal tuner(s) I've ever owned (for the record, I was a dedicated Boss TU 2/3 guy for many years until I came across the PolyTune line but today my second choice after the Polytune would be the Korg Pitchblack line).\",\n",
