# Homework 1
The tasks involved regression analysis using book ratings predicted from review length, with adjustments for scaling and incorporation of temporal features from review dates. Classification efforts centered on analyzing beer reviews, predicting positive ratings via logistic regression, and enhancing models by integrating additional data features such as beer styles and text analysis.

# Homework 2
The focus was on developing a diagnostic tool for classifying beers based on alcohol content, using one-hot encoding for beer styles. The model was extended to include ratings and review lengths as features. Jaccard similarity measures were employed for musical instruments reviews, with a focus on improving model performance through feature engineering and regularization.

# Homework 3
Play prediction models utilized popularity and Jaccard similarity metrics to predict game play likelihood. Tasks included handling both positive and sampled negative instances to build a robust validation set. Time played predictions were optimized using regularization techniques, evaluating performance across different data splits.

# Homework 4
This assignment focused on text mining and recommendation systems using Steam category data and GoodReads young adult reviews. Common words were extracted to build feature sets, and tf-idf was applied for text classification. Logistic regression was used for multi-class prediction, and item2vec models were implemented to find similar books based on user interactions.

# Midterm Exam
Predictive models were developed using linear regression to relate review length to gameplay hours, incorporating various transformations of the gameplay hours to enhance model accuracy. Classification involved using logistic regression to predict game playing duration based on review text length, applying different model evaluation strategies to refine predictions.

# Assignment 1
Recommender systems for video games were built, focusing on predicting whether a game would be played and the duration of play. The approach included analyzing user-game pair data, improving upon baseline models, and adjusting predictive strategies based on leaderboard performance to optimize accuracy and mean-squared error.

# Assignment 2
An open-ended project involved performing an exploratory analysis of a chosen dataset, defining a predictive task, and documenting results in a detailed report. The model was evaluated against standard baselines, with justifications for model choice and optimization strategy provided, along with an analysis of the modelâ€™s performance and the significance of findings.
